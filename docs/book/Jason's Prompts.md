# My Writing Process

## Brainstorming a Series

Brainstorming with AI is a lot less defined as later steps, but here are a few things I do/have done to help brainstorm a series.

System prompt:

*You are an expert creative writer and outliner. Your task is to help a human take their ideas and build it into an excellent series outline. It is important, as you are brainstorming, that the ideas remain consistent with the tropes and conventions of the current genre.*

*The current genre is: \[INSERT GENRE HERE\]*

I then usually will create a Project (or Space in Perplexity) and insert the above into the instructions. Then I will do a deep research about the tropes and conventions of the genre I’m writing in. I’ll take what the deep research gives me and include that as part of the context in my Project/Space. That way, as I’m working on the outline, the AI has constant access to the common tropes and conventions of that genre to help it guide what happens.

I then engage in a back and forth conversation with the AI, giving it details I already have prepared, and asking for ideas of what I’m lacking. (Note: asking for multiple ideas for a single thing you want is a good way to get the AI to act more creative. Don’t just ask for one idea, ask for 5-10 or more)

As this progresses, I will take what elements I like and include them in a Google Doc. Here is an example of what a finished series outline looks like for me: [https://docs.goo gle.com/document/d/12rgFfWGl7uM0On5sPC5KJwQchXD2TiUIfsIq1i\_ZuJA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12rgFfWGl7uM0On5sPC5KJwQchXD2TiUIfsIq1i_ZuJA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Outlining and Pre-writing Work

To outline, I have a little more of a unique multi-step process. 

### Step 1: The Call Sheet

First, I have what I call the “call sheet” prompt, which is all about getting a list of all the details I’ll need to outline the book.

To do this in a chatbot best, you can use the superprompt below, or create a “Project” in your chatbot of choice. You will then need to include the entirety of your braindump/series outline (from the last step).

From there, you’ll also want a list of tropes for your genre.

Both of these should be placed in your project, system prompt, or included in the superprompt below:

**The Call Sheet Prompt**

*\<braindump\>*

*\[INSERT BRAINDUMP/SERIES OUTLINE HERE\]*

*\</braindump\>*

*\<genre\_tropes\>*

*\[INSERT GENRE TROPES HERE\]*

*\</genre\_tropes\>*

*\<instructions\>*

*Given the above braindump information and genre tropes, I want you to create a pre-writing callsheet that has a list of everything the author will need to fully flesh out the characters, worldbuilding, and outline for \[INSERT YOUR BOOK TITLE HERE\]. Here's what you should include:*

*Characters: Make a complete list of characters, including minor ones, needed for this book. Label these as appropriate with their role in the story (protagonist, antagonist, side character, henchman, comic relief, love interest, etc.) Give a brief explanation of who the character is and their role in the story, but don't give too many details just yet. These should be no more than 1-2 sentences per character. When referencing a group of individuals instead of individual characters, make sure you name 3-5 minor characters who are or would be a part of that group, just so the author has named characters to use when writing scenes with members of those groups in them.*

*Worldbuilding Info: Make a complete list of all locations, objects, and other worldbuilding information that will be needed for this book. Give a brief explanation of what the worldbuilding element is and its role in the story, but don't give too many details just yet. These should be no more than one sentence per worldbuilding element.*

*Outline: Make a plan on what will be needed to fully outline this book. Do not actually start outlining the book yet, but give instructions on what will be needed and any suggestions you have.*

*\</instructions\>*

### Step 2: The Characters

Next, I make sure to flesh out the list of characters BEFORE we start the outline. If you are using a Project/Space in a chatbot, you’ll want to make sure it has access to your braindump/series outline, your callsheet from the previous step, and your genre tropes. 

Alternatively, you could insert these into the superprompt below.

**The Characters Prompt**

*\<braindump\>*

*\[INSERT BRAINDUMP/SERIES OUTLINE HERE\]*

*\</braindump\>*

*\<callsheet\>*

*\[INSERT CALLSHEET FROM PREVIOUS STEP HERE\]*

*\</callsheet\>*

*\<genre\_tropes\>*

*\[INSERT GENRE TROPES HERE\]*

*\</genre\_tropes\>*

*\<instructions\>*

*Given the above braindump information, genre tropes, and outline callsheet, I want you to create a fleshed-out list of all the important characters needed specifically for \[INSERT NAME OF YOUR BOOK HERE\].* 

*For each major character, I want you to have the following:*

*1\. A physical description*

*2\. Their primary role in the story (i.e. protagonist, antagonist, love interest, henchman, etc.)*

*3\. Their most appropriate Myers-Briggs profile, Enneagram, and Clifton Strengths.*

*4\. Their core motivation, what is their heart's desire that is driving them most of the time?*

*5\. A brief explanation of their background before the start of the story*

*6\. An interesting quirk, hobby, or something that makes them unique. This should be something that doesn't necessarily fit with the story, but makes the character more interesting.*

*7\. Dialogue style, how do they talk?* 

*8\. Dialogue examples, I want specific examples of dialogue they might give in relaxed, stressful, thoughtful and exciting situations. These dialogue samples do not have to be part of this particular story, they are just to show off the vocal mannerisms of the character.*

*For minor characters, just have 1-2 sentences for each that gives us a brief understanding of their background, their core desire, and their relationship to the plot.*

*Format your list using Markdown in the following format:*

*\#\# NAME OF BOOK HERE*

*\#\#\# Major Character Name:*

*\* Physical Description: \[insert details here\]*

*\* Role in Story: \[insert details here\]*

*\* Personality Profiles: \[insert details here\]*

*\* Core Motivation: \[insert details here\]*

*\* Background: \[insert details here\]*

*\* Quirk: \[insert details here\]*

*\* Dialogue Style: \[insert details here\]*

*\* Dialogue Samples: \[insert details here\]*

*\[continue this for all major characters\]*

*\#\#\# Minor Characters:*

*\* \[MINOR CHARACTER NAME\]: \[1-2 sentence description here\]*

*\* \[MINOR CHARACTER NAME\]: \[1-2 sentence description here\]*

*\[continue for all minor characters\]*

*Only include the asked-for character details. Do not add any preamble, commentary, or anything other than what I've asked for above.*

*\</instructions\>*

### Step 3: The Worldbuilding

Next, we do a similar prompt for the worldbuilding elements. If you are using a Project/Space in a chatbot, you’ll want to make sure it has access to your braindump/series outline, your callsheet from the previous step, and your genre tropes. 

Alternatively, you could insert these into the superprompt below.

**The Worldbuilding Prompt**

*\<braindump\>*

*\[INSERT BRAINDUMP/SERIES OUTLINE HERE\]*

*\</braindump\>*

*\<callsheet\>*

*\[INSERT CALLSHEET FROM PREVIOUS STEP HERE\]*

*\</callsheet\>*

*\<genre\_tropes\>*

*\[INSERT GENRE TROPES HERE\]*

*\</genre\_tropes\>*

*\<instructions\>*

*Given the above braindump, genre tropes, and outline callsheet, I want you to create a fleshed-out list of all important setting and worldbuilding elements needed specifically for \[INSERT YOUR BOOK TITLE HERE\].* 

*I want you to organize all worldbuilding elements into categories. Which categories you use will depend on the genre and what you already have available to you in the outline and callsheet, however, some of the categories you MIGHT use include:*

*\-High-level Worldbuilding*

*\-Setting(s)/Locations*

*\-Magic Systems/Technology*

*\-Groups/Races*

*\-Gods/Dieties*

*\-Geography/Nature*

*\-Population/Politics*

*\-Culture*

*\-History/Lore*

*\-Religion/Beliefs*

*\-Languages*

*Do not use a category if it doesn't apply to the book/series, or if there aren't elements in the callsheet that apply to that category.*

*Format your list using Markdown in the following format:*

*\#\# NAME OF BOOK HERE*

*\#\#\# WORLDBUILDING CATEGORY HERE:*

*\* NAME OF WORLDBUILDING ELEMENT: \[insert 3-4 sentences here, make the details specific\]*

*\* NAME OF WORLDBUILDING ELEMENT: \[insert 3-4 sentences here, make the details specific\]*

*\* NAME OF WORLDBUILDING ELEMENT: \[insert 3-4 sentences here, make the details specific\]*

*\[continue for each worldbuilding element in this category\]*

*\#\#\# NEXT WORLDBUILDING CATEGORY HERE:*

*\* NAME OF WORLDBUILDING ELEMENT: \[insert 3-4 sentences here, make the details specific\]*

*\* NAME OF WORLDBUILDING ELEMENT: \[insert 3-4 sentences here, make the details specific\]*

*\* NAME OF WORLDBUILDING ELEMENT: \[insert 3-4 sentences here, make the details specific\]*

*\[continue for each worldbuilding element in this category\]*

*\[continue for each worldbuilding category\]*

*Only include the asked-for worldbuilding details. Do not add any preamble, commentary, or anything other than what I've asked for above.*

*\</instructions\>*

### Step 4: The Outline

Once you have your list of characters and worldbuilding finalized, it’s time to start creating your outline.

As before, if you’re using a Project/Space you can insert your braindump, characters, worldbuilding, genre tropes, and outlining template into the project’s files. Or you can use the superprompt exactly as outlined below:

**The Outlining Prompt**

*\<worldbuilding\>*

*\[INSERT YOUR WORLDBUILDING INFO HERE\]*

*\</worldbuilding\>*

*\<characters\>*

*\[INSERT YOUR CHARACTER INFO HERE\]*

*\</characters\>*

*\<braindump\>*

*\[INSERT YOUR BRAINSTORMING/SERIES OUTLINE INFO HERE\]*

*\</braindump\>*

*\<genre\_tropes\>*

*\[INSERT YOUR GENRE TROPES HERE\]*

*\</genre\_tropes\>*

*\<outline\_template\>*

*\[INSERT YOUR OUTLINING TEMPLATE HERE\]*

*\</outline\_template\>*

*\<instructions\>*

*Using the above \<worldbuilding\>, \<characters\>, \<braindump\>, \<genre\_tropes\> and \<outline\_template\> generate a fully fleshed out outline for \[INSERT YOUR BOOK TITLE HERE\]. The summary for each chapter should have specific details rather than vague allusions to what should happen. Write it as though you were going to hand it off to a ghostwriter to write the first draft.* 

*Format your list using Markdown in the following format:*

*\#\# NAME OF BOOK HERE*

*\#\#\# CHAPTER TITLE HERE:*

*\[Add a 200-250 word description of what happens in this chapter here in paragraph format (1-3 paragraphs) using specific details.\]*

*\#\#\# NEXT CHAPTER TITLE HERE:*

*\[Add a 200-250 word description of what happens in this chapter here in paragraph format (1-3 paragraphs) using specific details.\]*

*\[continue for each chapter in the outline\]*

*Only include the asked-for outline details. Do not add any preamble, commentary, or anything other than what I've asked for above.*

## Creating a Style Sheet

In order to go through some of the next few steps, you have to create a style sheet.

The good news is that once you’ve got your style sheet, you can reuse it on future projects. So you only have to do this once, or at least once per prose style.

Step 1 is to collect various samples of your writing. Personally, I grabbed about 6000 words of my own writing.

Step 2 is to run this style sheet prompt through an LLM. My favorite was Claude 4.1 Opus (but by the time you see this, there may be better options. For best results, test with multiple LLMs).

**The Style Sheet Prompt**

*\<writing\_samples\>*

*\[INSERT YOUR WRITING SAMPLES HERE\]*

*\</writing\_samples\>*

*Given the above writing samples, I want you to draft a prose style sheet, giving instructions on how to write like these samples, and even including small snippets from the samples as examples of your recommendations. This style sheet is intended for use by an LLM to write fiction in the same style. Make sure the style sheet emphasizes things like deep point of view and the show-don't-tell principle, with examples from the samples. Also specify which POV and tenses are used throughout the samples (there may be several different kinds). Have a section that focuses on dialogue style as well. Also have a section that specifies the average grade-level of the text. Do not focus on specific characters or other details from the samples, just focus on the prose style. The style sheet should be thorough.*

## Creating a Scene Brief

Next, we need to create a scene brief for the entire scene. This will be used to write the scene in one go.

The benefit of a scene brief is that it not only gives you the events of the scene (aka what we used to use Scene Beats for) but also details about the characters that might be different from one scene to the next. Things like the clothes they’re wearing, their mood, etc.

**The Scene Brief Prompt**

\<outline\>

\[INSERT FULL OUTLINE HERE\]

\</outline\>

\<characters\>

\[INSERT CHARACTER INFO HERE\]

\</characters\>

\<worldbuilding\>

\[INSERT WORLDBUILDING INFO HERE\]

\</worldbuilding\>

\<previous\_chapter\_text\>

\[INSERT PREVIOUS CHAPTER TEXT IF APPLICABLE\]

\</previous\_chapter\_text\>

\<instructions\>

Given the above outline and character/worldbuilding information, your task is to flesh out a “scene brief” for \[INSERT CHAPTER NAME HERE\]. Make sure the chapter is clearly labelled with the word(s) "\[INSERT CHAPTER NAME HERE\]". Do not name the chapter anything besides this. This scene brief should include the following:

POV: Third person limited from the perspective of \[Character Name\]. Justify this choice based on emotional and narrative importance in this chapter.

Genre: \[Pull this from the above documentation\] 

Plot (Verbatim \+ Beats): Extract the full "\[INSERT CHAPTER NAME HERE\]" plot summary from the outline and reproduce it verbatim in the scene brief. Then draft 20-25 scene beats to make sure you establish all of the important details of the scene. Make sure the beats focus exclusively on the plot, on what happens. Don't worry about establishing sensory details in this section.

Scene Function: Define the narrative function of this scene (e.g., Inciting Incident, Character Introduction, World Establishment, Foreshadowing Device).

Previous Chapter: Make sure the plot for this scene picks up appropriately after the end of the previous chapter text. (Disregard if this is the first chapter and there is no data for the previous chapter text).

Characters: List all characters appearing in this chapter. For each, provide:

Name & Role (protagonist, antagonist, mentor, etc.)

Physical Appearance: Focused on this scene — clothing, posture, visible wear, , etc.

Emotional State & Goals: What they feel and want in this moment; how this affects dialogue, reactions, or inner thought.

Behavioural Notes: Describe gestures, speech patterns, or tics shaped by mood or stakes.

Setting: Describe the environment using sensory-rich language. Include time of day, terrain, sounds, smells, lighting, weather, and other details relevant to the tone.

Main Source of Conflict: Explain the central dramatic tension in this chapter. Is it internal, interpersonal, societal, or environmental? Show how it escalates or shifts.

Tone & Style Notes: Guide the writing voice with specific cues:

Use the “clear window” prose (simple, evocative, never ornamental).

Emphasize clear magic system elements where appropriate.

Ensure dialogue reflects character intention.

Maintain momentum with sharp pacing and intentional foreshadowing.

Symbolism or Thematic Layer: Identify any symbols, metaphors, or archetypal moments that should emerge or be subtly introduced.

Continuity Considerations: Note any links to events from past chapters or foreshadowing for future chapters. Mention items, emotional threads, or worldbuilding that must remain consistent.

Other Notes: Include worldbuilding mechanics, scene transitions, or structural devices, if any).

\</instructions\>

## Writing the First Draft

Once you have your scene brief, you are ready to start writing the first draft. You will need all of your past information, including your stylesheet and sample prose. 

First Draft Writing Prompt

\<prose\_style\_example\>

\[INSERT PROSE STYLE EXAMPLES HERE\]

\</prose\_style\_example\>

\<style\_sheet\>

\[INSERT STYLE SHEET HERE\]

\</style\_sheet\>

\<prohibited\_words\>

\[INSERT FORBIDDEN WORDS DOCUMENT HERE\]

\</prohibited\_words\>

\<full\_context\>

\[INSERT OUTLINE, CHARACTER INFO, AND WORLDBUILDING INFO HERE\]

\</full\_context\>

\<previous\_chapter\_text\>

\[INSERT PREVIOUS CHAPTER IF RELEVANT\]

\</previous\_chapter\_text\>

\<scene\_brief\>

\[INSERT SCENE BRIEF HERE\]

\</scene\_brief\>

\<instructions\>

Your task is to write the entire "\[INSERT CHAPTER NAME HERE\]" based on the scene brief, and to cover it thoroughly, from deep point of view, writing the scene as if written by a bestselling novelist, and not rushing through the scene. Use the \<prose\_style\_example\> samples to know what the prose style of your chapter should be. The chapter should be as long as it needs to be to properly flesh everything out. Pay special care to show deep point of view and “showing not telling”, in order to fully flesh out the scene without skipping over important details. The reader should feel that they are fully immersed in the scene, seeing the events through the lens of the viewpoint character, rather than being simply told what happened.

Always keep the following rules in mind:

\- Write in active voice

\- Always follow the "show, don't tell" principle.

\- Avoid adverbs and cliches and overused/commonly used phrases. Aim for fresh and original descriptions.

\-Don't use any of the words in the \<prohibited\_words\> list.

\- Convey events and story through dialogue.

\- Mix short, punchy sentences with long, descriptive ones. Drop fill words to add variety.

\- Skip "he/she said said" dialogue tags and convey people's actions or face expressions through their speech

\- Avoid mushy dialog and descriptions, have dialogue always continue the action, never stall or add unnecessary fluff. Vary the descriptions to not repeat yourself.

\- Put dialogue on its own paragraph to separate scene and action.

\- Reduce indicators of uncertainty like "trying" or "maybe"

\-Reduce the use of metaphors

\-NEVER conclude the scene on your own, follow the beat instructions very closely. NEVER end with foreshadowing. NEVER write further than what I prompt you with. AVOID imagining possible endings, NEVER deviate from the instructions.

\-STOP EARLY if the continuation contains what was required in the instructions. You do not need to fill out the full amount of words possible.

\-Write in a clear, direct, and concise style. Avoid unnecessary details, complex sentence structures, and overly descriptive language. Focus on the key information and present it in the simplest form possible. Keep sentences short and easy to understand, without any extra elaboration or embellishment.

\-Word Count: The scene should be roughly 3000 words long. 

\-Previous Chapter Text: this new chapter should pick up appropriately following the end of the previous chapter, with no repeats of moments that have already been covered in the last chapter. (not applicable if you are writing the first chapter and there is no data for the previous chapter text yet.)

Write the full chapter “in the moment” from the POV character’s perspective.

1\. \*\*Deep POV & Show, Don’t Tell\*\*

2\. \*\*Active voice only\*\*

3\. \*\*No adverbs or clichés\*\*

4\. \*\*Dialogue carries action\*\* (no “he said” tags; show gestures)

5\. \*\*Sentence rhythm\*\*: vary short punchy lines with lush descriptions

6\. \*\*Stop exactly at the scene’s conclusion\*\* (no foreshadowing beyond the brief)

Format the output using Markdown as needed.

\</instructions\>

## Light Line Editing

In my experience, editing with AI, or having AI weed out a lot of the “AI-isms” from itself is not easily done.

In fact, most editing passes can actually make it worse.

But I have found that when done right, a “light” editing pass can sometimes make some good improvements of the text.

There are a couple requirements to make this work:

1) This must be a two-part process (at least for now, maybe future LLMs can do this in one)  
2) It must use a “thinking” LLM

I also recommend turning the temperature of whatever model you’re using down a bit, since this is an instance where you don’t want the model to get creative, you want it to follow your instructions to the letter.

*Note: at the time of this writing I use Gemini 2.5 Pro with a temperature of 0.7 for this step. But this will likely be outdated soon, and you may have better options in the future.*

### Step 1: Getting the Improvement Plan

The first step is to ask the LLM to analyze your chapter (only do a chapter at a time) and make a plan to improve that chapter. Here is the prompt I use:

**Improvement Plan Prompt**

*\<previous\_chapter\_text\>*

*\[INSERT PREVIOUS CHAPTER TEXT HERE\]*

*\</previous\_chapter\_text\>*

*\<chapter\>*

*\[INSERT CHAPTER YOU WISH TO ANALYZE HERE\]*

*\</chapter\>*

*\<scene\_brief\>*

*\[INSERT SCENE BRIEF FOR THE CHAPTER HERE\]*

*\</scene\_brief\>*

*\<prose\_style\_example\>*

*\[INSERT PROSE STYLE SAMPLES HERE\]*

*\</prose\_style\_example\>*

*\<style\_sheet\>*

*\[INSERT STYLE SHEET HERE\]*

*\</style\_sheet\>*

*\<prohibited\_words\>*

*\[INSERT LIST OF AI-ISMS HERE\]*

*\</prohibited\_words\>*

*\<instructions\>*

*Given the above chapter, I want you to critique the chapter on a line-by-line basis and find ways to improve the chapter. Give specific examples. Here are a few things to look out for:*

*\-Chapter Flow: Identify internal structure (hook, tension rise, end-of-chapter promise)*

*\-Rhythm Check: Highlight slow pacing (exposition/info-dumps). If needed, suggest scene breaks or cuts.*

*\-Show vs Tell: Highlight areas that are telling instead of showing, or not demonstrating good deep point of view for the character. Highlight exposition blocks for sensory or active-scene rewrites.*

*\-Cliches: Highlight common cliches, and overreliance on metaphors, and other signs of bad writing on the sentence level.*

*\-Adverbs: Identify any over-reliance on adverbs*

*\-Dialogue Tags: Identify dialogue tags that are not “said” or “asked”. Make suggestions for which ones should be changed to "said" or "asked".*

*\-Passive Voice: Flag instances of passive voice.*

*\-Zero Fluff: Highlight overly wordy sentences and paragraphs/areas where you could reduce fluff, as well as instances of mushy dialogue or descriptions*

*Prose Sample: Give instructions on how to make the text more like the prose style example text above.*

*\-Voice Check: Compare each major/recurring character’s dialogue and behavior against their established profile; flag off-character moments.*

*\-Motivation Alignment: Ensure each action drives plot or character growth.",*

*\-Minor Characters: Verify new or returning townsfolk match previously defined traits or enrich them without contradiction.*

*\-Open Questions: Note any unclear motives, logic gaps, or plot holes.*

*\-Ending: Did the text end where the scene brief said it should? If not, specify where the chapter should end.*

*\-Beginning: Did the text begin in a way that feels like a natural continuation from the previous\_chapter\_text? If not, specify how it should begin.*

*\-Reader Experience: Provide a 'Takeaway'—does the chapter leave readers eager for the next installment?*

*Overall, your most important task is to identify these problem areas, as well as any instances where the text sounds like it was AI-written or used any of the words in the \<prohibited\_words\> list. The goal is to identify ways to make the text sound more human and natural. Once you’ve identified ways to do this, make a plan to improve the text. Give specific examples and recommendations.*

*\</instructions\>*

### Step 2: Implementing the Improvement Plan

Alright, now that you have an improvement plan for your chapter, it’s time to use it to make edits to your book.

Please note that the following prompt usually makes just small line edits. I’ve found that asking the AI to make bigger sweeping edits (aka a rewrite) results in too many changes being made that it almost makes the new version worse, especially if the LLM you’re using is not as powerful as the one that wrote the first draft.

This is why I specifically use the word “implement” rather than “rewrite” because I find the latter word often triggers the AI to start from scratch, when what we really want is a few minor changes here and there that make the story better.

*\<original\_chapter\>*

*\[INSERT ORIGINAL DRAFT OF CHAPTER HERE\]*

*\</original\_chapter\>*

*\<improvement\_plan\>*

*\[INSERT IMPROVEMENT PLAN HERE\]*

*\</improvement\_plan\>*

*\<instructions\>*

*Using the text of the \<original\_chapter\> and the \<improvement\_plan\> I want you to implement the suggestions in the improvement plan. Only implement the suggested changes, and do not change anything else about the original\_chapter. Reproduce the entire chapter with the suggested changes made.*

*The chapter should begin with the chapter header written in Markdown as an H2 heading like this: "\#\#\[INSERT CHAPTER NAME HERE\]""*

*\</instructions\>*
