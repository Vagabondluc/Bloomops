# Spec 04: Book Workflow (BloomOps Mapping)

## Purpose
Define the v0.1 end-to-end book workflow using `book/Jason's Prompts.md` and map each step to Bloom verbs.

## Source
- `book/Jason's Prompts.md`

## Bloom Mapping
- Brainstorming a series: CREATE (generate ideas), UNDERSTAND (summarize tropes)
- Call sheet: ANALYZE (decompose needs), APPLY (format checklist)
- Characters: CREATE (character details), APPLY (format)
- Worldbuilding: CREATE (settings), APPLY (format)
- Outline: CREATE (chapter summaries)
- Style sheet: ANALYZE (derive style rules)
- Scene brief: ANALYZE (decompose scene), APPLY (format)
- First draft: CREATE (chapter text)
- Improvement plan: EVALUATE (critique)
- Implement plan: APPLY (edit within constraints)

## Required Artifacts
- series outline
- callsheet
- character list
- worldbuilding list
- full outline
- style sheet
- scene briefs
- chapter drafts
- improvement plan
- revised chapter

## Workflow Contract
- Each artifact has a required input list and output format.
- Each step must reference prior artifacts via trace IDs.
- Any missing input triggers an assumption log entry.
