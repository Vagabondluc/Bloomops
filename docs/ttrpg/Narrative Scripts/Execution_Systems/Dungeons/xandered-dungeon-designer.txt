# Xandered Dungeon Designer

## Objective
Create a non-linear, complex dungeon that encourages exploration and strategic play.

## Instructions
1. Implement Multiple Entrances:
   - Design at least two distinct entry points
   - Vary difficulty and approach for each entrance

2. Create Interconnected Loops:
   - Design paths that circle back to previous areas
   - Ensure multiple routes between key locations

3. Develop Vertical Complexity:
   - Include multiple levels with various connections
   - Use stairs, chutes, elevators for level transitions

4. Incorporate Discontinuous Connections:
   - Add shortcuts that skip levels or areas
   - Design one-way passages for added complexity

5. Design Secret and Unusual Paths:
   - Hide alternative routes behind secret doors or puzzles
   - Create unconventional paths (e.g., underwater tunnels)

6. Add Sub-Levels and Pocket Dimensions:
   - Design small, self-contained areas off main paths
   - Use magical or technological means for access

7. Implement Divided Levels:
   - Create levels that require visiting other levels to fully explore
   - Use barriers or puzzles to segment individual levels

8. Incorporate Minor Elevation Shifts:
   - Use short stairs or slopes within single levels
   - Create illusion of continuous space across multiple levels

9. Design for Exploration:
   - Reward thorough exploration with secrets and treasures
   - Ensure multiple solutions for major obstacles

10. Balance Complexity:
    - Ensure dungeon remains navigable despite complexity
    - Include landmarks for player orientation
