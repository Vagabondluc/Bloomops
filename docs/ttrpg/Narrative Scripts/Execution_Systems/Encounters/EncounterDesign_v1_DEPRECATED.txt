Design an encounter for a group on a journey. Include an environmental effect with in-game mechanics, a skill challenge or roleplay scenario, specify the opponent's statblock or source, and calculate the XP rewards based on objectives. Organize the content into sections with estimated playtime and provide depth to NPCs and monsters, describing their goals and tactics. This should be presented in a concise 500-word format.
