# Faction Conflict Simulator

## Objective
Simulate dynamic interactions between dungeon factions to create evolving scenarios.

## Instructions
1. Create Faction List:
   - Identify all factions in the dungeon
   - Assign a number to each faction

2. Develop Faction Profiles:
   - Define each faction's goals and resources
   - Note current territory and key NPCs

3. Create Random Faction Table:
   - List factions with corresponding die rolls
   - Include "Wandering Adventurers" and "Outsiders" options
   - Add "Roll Again Twice" for multi-party conflicts

4. Establish Conflict Check Frequency:
   - Decide how often to check (e.g., between sessions)
   - Roll 1d6, with 1 indicating conflict occurs

5. Determine Involved Factions:
   - Roll twice on faction table to select participants
   - Reroll or assume civil strife if same faction rolled twice

6. Create Conflict Outcome Table:
   - Include results like "Stalemate," "Faction Damaged," "Factions Unite"
   - Assign probabilities to each outcome

7. Resolve Conflict:
   - Roll on outcome table to determine result
   - Interpret result based on involved factions

8. Implement Changes:
   - Update faction territories and resources
   - Modify adversary rosters to reflect losses or gains

9. Generate Narrative:
   - Create brief description of conflict and aftermath
   - Consider how this affects dungeon dynamics

10. Update Dungeon State:
    - Revise maps to show territory changes
    - Adjust encounter tables based on new faction standings
