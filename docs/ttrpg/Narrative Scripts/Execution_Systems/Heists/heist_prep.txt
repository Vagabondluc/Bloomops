Heist Preparation Guidelines for an LLM:

1. Overview and Purpose:
   - As the LLM, your role is to create a detailed heist preparation document that outlines the key elements for a compelling heist scenario.
   - Heist scenarios challenge players to survey a target location, formulate a strategic plan, and execute a high-stakes theft or infiltration operation.

2. Heist Objective Selection:
   - Determine the primary objective of the heist, which can include:
     - Stealing a valuable object (e.g., artwork, jewelry, data)
     - Retrieving sensitive information (e.g., documents, computer files, secrets)
     - Sabotaging critical infrastructure or resources
     - Assassinating or kidnapping a high-profile target
   - Consider incorporating multiple or tiered objectives to increase the complexity and challenge.
   - Ensure the objective is compelling enough to drive the players to undertake the risky heist.

3. Heist Location Design:
   a. Surveying the Target:
      - Determine the location that houses the heist objective, such as a museum, bank, manor house, or corporate facility.
      - Establish the key features of the location that can be surveyed by the players, including entrances, exits, security measures, and the objective's placement.
      - Decide which elements of the location will be trivial, challenging, or impossible for the players to survey beforehand.

   b. Entry Points:
      - Incorporate multiple entry points to the location, each with its own security features and potential complications.
      - Ensure at least two entries are available, with one or more being secured (requiring skill checks) and one or more being hidden (requiring discovery).
      - Consider the strategic implications of the entry point choices for the players' heist plan.

   c. Layered Defenses:
      - Design a series of security measures and obstacles the players must overcome to reach the objective.
      - Include passive obstacles (locks, traps, physical challenges) and active forces (guards, patrols, alarm systems).
      - Organize the defenses in a way that forces the players to navigate multiple layers of security.

   d. Objective Placement:
      - Determine the location of the heist objective within the secured facility.
      - Consider placing the objective in a heavily fortified or remote area to increase the challenge.
      - Alternatively, positioning the objective behind a single heavily secured entry point can create a different type of challenge.

4. Blueprint Creation:
   - Prepare a detailed blueprint or floorplan depicting the heist location.
   - Incorporate the results of the players' survey, including both known and unknown/hidden elements.
   - The blueprint should serve as a valuable tool for the players to plan their heist strategy.

5. Team Composition and Roles:
   - Determine the ideal composition of the heist crew, considering the complementary skills and abilities required.
   - Assign specialized roles to the players, such as:
     - Lookout
     - Safecracker
     - Technical specialist
     - Getaway driver
     - Muscle
   - Ensure the team has the necessary expertise to execute the various aspects of the heist plan.

6. Preparation Activities:
   - Outline the steps the players can take to gather intelligence, acquire resources, and rehearse the heist plan.
   - Consider opportunities for the players to:
     - Conduct additional reconnaissance of the target location
     - Obtain specialized equipment or tools
     - Cultivate contacts or allies who can provide assistance
     - Practice the execution of the heist plan in a controlled environment
