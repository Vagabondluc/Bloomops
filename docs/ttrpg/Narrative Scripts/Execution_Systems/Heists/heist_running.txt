1. Scenario Overview
2. Detailed Location Description
3. Security Measures in Action
4. Objective Specifics
5. NPC and Adversary Profiles
6. Player Options and Resources
7. Running the Heist
8. Dynamic Elements
9. Aftermath and Consequences

- Design a timing system or tension meter to keep the heist exciting.

### 8. Dynamic Elements

### 9. Aftermath and Consequences
- Develop a range of possible endings based on player actions and success levels.

## Additional Instructions

1. Always refer back to the heist_prep document to ensure consistency with the initial concept.
2. Where the prep document lacks detail, use creative liberty to fill in gaps in a way that enhances the scenario.
3. Maintain a consistent tone and style throughout the document.
4. Use markdown formatting for clarity and organization.
5. Include GM tips and alternate suggestions throughout to increase the scenario's flexibility.

Remember, your task is to transform the initial prep into a fully realized, ready-to-run heist scenario. Focus on expanding, detailing, and operationalizing the information provided in the heist_prep document.
