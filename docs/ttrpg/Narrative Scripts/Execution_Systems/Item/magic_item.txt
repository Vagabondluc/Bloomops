# LLM Guidelines for Conceptualizing and Describing a Magic Item

As an LLM, your task is to create a comprehensive document that conceptualizes and describes a magic item for a tabletop roleplaying game. This document should provide a detailed description of the item, its properties, and its role in the game world.

## Output File
Generate a file named "magic_item_concept.md" with the following structure:

1. Item Name and Type
2. Purpose and Function
3. Physical Description
4. Magical Properties
5. Activation and Usage
6. Rarity and Value
7. History and Lore
8. Special Considerations

## Section Details

### 1. Item Name and Type
- Create a unique and evocative name for the magic item.
- Specify the type of magic item (Armor, Potion, Ring, Rod, Scroll, Staff, Wand, Weapon, or Wondrous item).
- If applicable, specify the subtype (e.g., for weapons: longsword, warhammer; for armor: chain mail, shield).

### 2. Purpose and Function
- Describe the original purpose for which the item was created.
- Explain the primary function of the item in gameplay terms.
- If the item replicates a spell effect, specify which spell and any modifications to its normal function.

### 3. Physical Description
- Provide a vivid description of the item's appearance.
- Include details on size, weight, material, and any unique visual features.
- Describe any changes in appearance when the item is activated or in use.

### 4. Magical Properties
- List and describe all magical effects and bonuses provided by the item.
- Include any permanent effects on the wielder.
- Specify if the item grants new abilities or enhances existing ones.
- If applicable, detail any negative effects or drawbacks of using the item.

### 5. Activation and Usage
- Explain how the item is activated (command word, physical action, mental command, etc.).
- Specify if the item uses charges, and if so, how many and how they recharge.
- Detail any limitations on usage (times per day, specific conditions, etc.).
- If the item requires attunement, state this and any class or other restrictions on who can attune to it.

### 6. Rarity and Value
- Assign a rarity level (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, Legendary, Artifact, or Fabled).
- Provide an estimated value range based on the rarity.
- If the item is an Artifact or Fabled item, note that it is priceless.

### 7. History and Lore
- Create a brief history of the item, including its creation and notable past wielders.
- For Artifacts, include its significant impact on the world and a unique method of destruction.
- For Fabled items, describe how it grows in power with the wielder.

### 8. Special Considerations
- If the item is cursed, describe the nature and effects of the curse.
- For sentient items, provide:
  - Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores
  - Methods of communication
  - Senses the item possesses
  - Personality traits, motivations, and goals

## Additional Instructions

1. Use clear, evocative language throughout the document.
2. Ensure the item's power level is appropriate for its rarity (refer to the Magic Item Rarity table in the source text).
3. For items with spell effects, don't exceed the highest spell circle listed for the item's rarity.
4. Use markdown formatting for better readability and organization.
5. Keep the total description concise but comprehensive, aiming for 300-500 words.
6. Ensure that the item description provides enough detail for a game master to easily incorporate it into their game.

Remember, your task is to generate a complete, ready-to-use document describing a magic item. This description should provide all necessary information for understanding the item's function, role in the game world, and mechanical effects in gameplay.
