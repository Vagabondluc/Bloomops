# LLM Guidelines for Conceptualizing and Describing Fantastical Locations

As an LLM, your task is to create a comprehensive document that conceptualizes and describes a fantastical location for use in a tabletop roleplaying game or storytelling scenario. This document should provide a vivid, engaging, and mechanically useful description of a unique and memorable location.

## Output File
Generate a file with the following structure:

1. Evocative Name
2. Location Aspects
3. Scale and Age
4. Sensory Details
5. Potential Interactions
6. Hidden Secrets or Lore
7. Connections to Character Backgrounds (if applicable)

## Section Details

### 1. Evocative Name
- Create a compelling and imaginative name for the location that immediately captures attention.
- The name should be brief (3-5 words) but highly descriptive.
- Examples: "The Bridge of Teeth," "Fang of the First Wyrm," "Crucified Titan"

### 2. Location Aspects
- Provide exactly three aspects that describe key features of the location.
- Each aspect should be a short phrase (5-10 words) that highlights a unique, interactive, or notable element of the location.
- Ensure these aspects can be used for storytelling or mechanical purposes in a game.
- Examples: 
  - "Huge saber-toothed bestial skull bursting out of the ground"
  - "Bones tied together with cracked and splitting leather and sinew"
  - "Deep hole in the earth below the geode like an infected wound"

### 3. Scale and Age
- Describe the size of the location, emphasizing its grandiosity or uniqueness.
- Indicate the age of the location or its key features, focusing on ancient or primordial elements.
- Use specific measurements or time periods to convey scale and age effectively.
- Examples:
  - "Mile-high waterfall cascading for millennia"
  - "Thirty-foot-high fang thrust up out of the ground, predating known civilization"

### 4. Sensory Details
- Provide vivid descriptions engaging at least three senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste).
- Use evocative language to make the location feel alive and present.
- Examples:
  - "Howling wind sounds like moaning through the bone bridge"
  - "Noxious fumes perpetually flowing from the crater, carrying a sulfurous stench"

### 5. Potential Interactions
- Describe 2-3 ways characters might interact with the location or its aspects.
- Include potential challenges, opportunities, or points of interest.
- Examples:
  - "The circle of glyphs on the skull's forehead beckons magical investigation"
  - "Razor-sharp emerald deposits offer both danger and potential wealth"

### 6. Hidden Secrets or Lore
- Suggest 1-2 hidden elements or pieces of lore connected to the location.
- These should provide hooks for further exploration or storytelling.
- Examples:
  - "Rumors speak of a hidden chamber beneath the titan's feet"
  - "Ancient texts refer to this location as a nexus of otherworldly energy"

### 7. Connections to Character Backgrounds (if applicable)
- If character backgrounds are provided, suggest 1-2 ways the location might tie into a character's history or knowledge.
- These connections should be loose enough to adapt to various characters.
- Examples:
  - "The iconography might be recognized by a character with religious training"
  - "A character with a background in archeology could identify the age of the ruins"

## Additional Instructions

1. Emphasize the fantastic nature of the location through scale, age, or otherworldly elements.
2. Use clear, vivid language throughout the document.
3. Aim for a description that could fit a single scene or encounter, rather than an entire dungeon or city.
4. Use markdown formatting for better readability and organization.
5. Keep the total description concise, aiming for no more than 300-400 words in total.
6. Ensure that the location description leaves room for improvisation and adaptation in gameplay.

Remember, your task is to generate a complete, ready-to-use document describing a fantastical location. This description should inspire imagination, provide clear visual and sensory cues, and offer potential for meaningful interaction in a game or story context.
