## Additional Instructions

1. Use clear, evocative language throughout the document.
2. Provide specific examples to illustrate key points.
3. Ensure the campaign concept allows for player agency and character development.
4. Use markdown formatting for better readability and organization.
5. Keep the total description comprehensive and detailed, aiming for 3000-4000 words.
6. Ensure that the campaign description provides enough detail for a game master to begin planning individual sessions, while leaving room for adaptation and improvisation.
7. Include sidebars or callout boxes with additional tips, variant ideas, or inspirational content.

Remember, your task is to generate a complete, ready-to-use document describing a campaign concept. This description should provide a solid foundation for a game master to build a long-term, engaging campaign that can evolve based on player actions and interests.

As the LLM, you must generate the content for the "campaign_prep.md" file based on these guidelines. Do not simply repeat the guidelines, but use them to create a fully realized campaign concept. Be creative and detailed in your approach, ensuring that the resulting document provides a rich, flexible framework for an extended roleplaying campaign.
