**Scene Crafting System for TTRPG**

**Purpose:**
Streamline TTRPG scene creation by focusing on dramatic and meaningful moments, skipping mundane details.

**Key Principles:**
- **Relevance:** Keep scenes relevant to the game's narrative.
- **Interest:** Ensure scenes are engaging and avoid empty time.
- **Action-Oriented:** Focus on meaningful player choices.

**Avoiding Empty Time:**
- Skip unimportant details.
- Jump directly to significant events or decisions.

**Scene Transitions:**
- **Sharp Cuts:** Move directly to the next key moment.
  - Example: "You leave the tavern and arrive at Lady Isabella’s study."
- **Abstract Time:** Summarize uneventful periods.
  - Example: "Several days pass as you cross the Great Plain."

**Scene Framing:**
- **Agenda:** Define the scene's purpose.
  - Example: "Can the PCs convince Lady Isabella to support their cause?"
- **Setup:** Identify characters, objectives, environment, and context.

**Running Scenes:**
- Introduce obstacles to prevent trivial resolutions.
- Example: "To get the data chip, first make Michael admit he has it."

**Initiating Action (The Bang):**
- Start scenes with an event forcing meaningful choices.
  - Example: "An arrow flies past Natasha’s head, prompting an initiative check."

**Setting the Scene:**
- **Location:** Describe the immediate environment with relevant details.
  - Example: "You’re in the back room of the Red Hand, a dimly lit space filled with the scent of old books."
- **Characters:** Identify roles (leads, features, extras).

**Ending Scenes:**
- Cut away when the agenda is resolved or new significant choices arise.
- Avoid second lulls—introduce new events or transition to the next scene.

**Transitions:**
- Move smoothly to the next scene.
  - Example: "As the scene ends, you find yourself standing outside the council chambers, ready for the next challenge."

This system ensures efficient and engaging scene creation, keeping the focus on the story and player choices.
