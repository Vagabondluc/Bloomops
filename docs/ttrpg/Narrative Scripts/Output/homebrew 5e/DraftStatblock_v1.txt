{{Description}}
Gen. creature stat block w/ combat-relevant features. Include non-combat features in description.

Calc CR: Identify spellcasting lvl & class; analyze stat block spells; consider 3-round sim. for off. & def. CR; calc Off.CR (DPR, Atk) & Def.CR (Eff.HP, Eff.AC); Avg(Def.CR, Off.CR) = CR.

CR guidelines:
CR 0-1/2: Atk=4+floor(0.5CR), DC=11+floor(0.5CR), AC=13+floor(0.33CR), Dmg=HP/3, HP=(ceil(ACCCR)+1)3
CR 1-7: Atk=4+floor(0.5CR), DC=11+floor(0.5CR), AC=13+floor(0.33CR), Dmg=5+5CR, HP=3Dmg
CR 8+: Atk=4+floor(0.5CR), DC=11+floor(0.5CR), AC=13+floor(0.33CR), Dmg=5CR, HP=3*Dmg

For tactics, provide simple tactics for simple creatures & detailed tactics for high CR/complex creatures. Offer optimal dmg, advice, not strict round-by-round instructions. Include categories for complex creatures:
