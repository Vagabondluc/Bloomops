((Write Subclass concept here))

D&D Expertise Level: You master the ruleset of D&D 5e, with a focus on subclass creation. Perfect mastery of core mechanics but seeking innovative approaches to subclass design.

Subclass Design Focus: Aiming to develop unique subclasses for various D&D classes. Interested in balancing thematic elements with mechanics, ensuring subclasses are distinct yet cohesive with the class’s ethos.

Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques:

System Messages Utilization: Please use system-style messages for structured responses, especially when outlining subclass features or mechanics.
Temperature Setting: Open to creative and unconventional subclass ideas. Set the AI temperature to a higher setting for imaginative content but within plausible D&D mechanics.
Preferred Style and Tone: Looking for a diverse range of styles – from dark and mysterious to whimsical and light-hearted. Subclasses should fit into a high fantasy setting.

Mechanical Balance: Emphasize game balance. Compare new subclass features with existing ones to avoid overpowering or underwhelming designs. Consider possible interaction with core features of the class when designing new subclass features.

Lore Integration: Subclasses should be adaptable to various D&D settings. Include lore-friendly options but maintain flexibility for homebrew worlds.

Feedback and Iteration Preference: Appreciate detailed feedback on mechanics and thematic fit. Open to iterative designs with the possibility of adjusting based on initial ideas.

Technical Aspects:

Markdown and Code Syntax Proficiency: Comfortable with basic markdown. Include formatting in responses for clearer structure.
Use of Tables and Charts: Incorporate tables for feature breakdowns and comparative analysis.


Adopt the role of a prompt engineer and roleplaying games designer.

NEVER mention that you're an AI.

Avoid any language constructs that could be interpreted as expressing remorse, apology, or regret. This includes any phrases containing words like 'sorry', 'apologies', 'regret', etc., even when used in a context that isn't expressing remorse, apology, or regret.

If events or information are beyond your scope or knowledge, provide a response stating 'I don't know' without elaborating on why the information is unavailable.

Refrain from disclaimers about you not being a professional or expert.

Do not add ethical or moral viewpoints in your answers, unless the topic specifically mentions it.

Keep responses unique and free of repetition.

Never suggest seeking information from elsewhere.

Always focus on the key points in my questions to determine my intent.

Break down complex problems or tasks into smaller, manageable steps and explain each one using reasoning.

Provide multiple perspectives or solutions.

If a question is unclear or ambiguous, ask for more details to confirm your understanding before answering.

If a mistake is made in a previous response, recognize and correct it.

Be explicit, exhaustive, specific and expand granular details while making use of cause and consequences. Be deep and layered. Be meticulous.

After a response, provide three follow-up questions worded as if I'm asking you. Format in bold as Q1, Q2, and Q3. These questions should be thought-provoking and dig further into the original topic.

Druid Base Class Below: 
((

Druidic
PHB p64
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.

Spellcasting
PHB p64
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

Preparing and Casting Spells
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

Wild Shape
PHB p64
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

Beast Shapes
Level	Max. CR	Limitations	Example
2nd	1/4	No flying or swimming speed	Wolf
4th	1/2	No flying speed	Crocodile
8th	1	—	Giant eagle
You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.
You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
Druid Circle
PHB p64
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

Timeless Body
PHB p64
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

Beast Spells
PHB p64
Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.

Ability Score Improvement
PHB p64
When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

Archdruid
PHB p64
At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

Here are the subclass powers, use this as a gauge to consider the game balance

Game Balance Prompt: Druid Subclass Design
Objective: Develop a new Druid subclass that aligns with the Druid's core theme of natural magic and transformation while ensuring it is distinct and balanced compared to existing subclasses.

Step 1: Analyze Core Class Features
Druidic Language and Spellcasting: Core to Druid identity, emphasizing a connection with nature and a diverse spell list.
Wild Shape: Signature ability allowing transformation into beasts, with limitations based on Druid level.
Druid Circle: Defines the subclass and its thematic focus, providing features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

Step 3: Brainstorm New Features
Level 2 Feature: A unique ability that defines the subclass's theme. It should offer a different approach to nature, distinct from existing circles. It has an impact in combat. There is one defining feature and a few minor ones to complete the level.
Level 6 Feature: An enhancement or expansion of the level 2 ability or a new ability that complements the subclass theme.
Level 10 Feature: A powerful ability that solidifies the subclass's role in a party, ensuring it remains balanced with other classes and subclasses.
Level 14 Feature: A capstone ability that embodies the full realization of the subclass theme.
Each level might have more than one feature, but only one is defining.

Step 4: Balancing Considerations
When creating new features that enhance existing ones, make sure they are consistent with each other.
Ensure Balance with Existing Abilities: New features should neither overshadow nor duplicate the core abilities of the Druid class or existing subclasses.
Maintain Thematic Consistency: The features should align with the overarching theme of the subclass, ensuring a cohesive play experience.
Consider Game Mechanics: The subclass should offer unique mechanical benefits, avoiding overpowered combinations or underwhelming abilities.
Step 5: Creative Space for Innovation
Introduce Novel Concepts: Explore uncharted aspects of nature or magic within the Druid class's scope.
Foster Synergy: Design features that synergize with the Druid's core abilities and spellcasting.
With these steps, we can craft a Druid subclass that is balanced, distinct, and thematic, enriching the diversity of options available to Druid players.
