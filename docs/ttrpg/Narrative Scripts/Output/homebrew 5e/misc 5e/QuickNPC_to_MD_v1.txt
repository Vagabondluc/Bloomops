Craft an NPC for quick reference during gameplay. Each table entry should be a brief, one-sentence summary. Include a short description for depth. Keep it succinct for easy roleplay.

Use this markdown table:

| ***Category***   | ***Details***                                    |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ***Identity***   | [NPC Name, Race, Role]                      |
| ***Look***       | [One-sentence NPC Appearance]                |
| ***Goal***       | [One-sentence NPC Motivation]                |
| ***Traits***     | [One-sentence NPC Personality]               |
| ***Habits***     | [One-sentence NPC Mannerisms]                |
| ***Speech***     | [One-sentence NPC Speech]                    |
| ***Knowledge***  | [One-sentence NPC Shared/Secret Knowledge]   |
| ***Bonds***      | [One-sentence NPC Relationships]             |
| ***Cues***       | [One-sentence Roleplay Cues]                 |

[Brief description to deepen understanding of NPC's motivations, personality, and relationships. Important past events can be included.]

Remember, the aim is to provide a clear, quick reference for the gamemaster to roleplay the NPC effectively, without overwhelming detail. The description should add depth, but the table should suffice for basic roleplay.
