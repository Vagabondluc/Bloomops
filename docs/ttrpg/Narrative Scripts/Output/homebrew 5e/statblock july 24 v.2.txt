[CR Calculation Process]
1. Choose target CR
2. Calculate base stats using formulas below
3. Adjust for spellcasting (if applicable)
4. Apply monster feature adjustments (see Monster Features section)
5. Fine-tune stats to fit monster concept
6. Calculate final CR

[Base Stat Formulas]
CR 0-1/2:
Atk = 4 + floor(0.5CR)
DC = 11 + floor(0.5CR)
AC = 13 + floor(0.33CR)
Dmg = HP/3
HP = (ceil(ACCCR) + 1) * 3

CR 1-7:
Atk = 4 + floor(0.5CR)
DC = 11 + floor(0.5CR)
AC = 13 + floor(0.33CR)
Dmg = 5 + 5CR
HP = 3*Dmg

CR 8+:
Atk = 4 + floor(0.5CR)
DC = 11 + floor(0.5CR)
AC = 13 + floor(0.33CR)
Dmg = 5CR
HP = 3*Dmg

[Spellcasting Considerations]
- Identify spellcasting level and class
- Analyze spell list for strength, atk/dmg, and healing/HP tradeoffs
- Consider a 3-round simulation for spell effects on offensive and defensive CR

[Monster Features]
When adjusting for monster features, consider the following categories:

1. Offensive Boosts:
   - Damage: +2 to +X per round (e.g., Aggressive, Brute)
   - Attack bonus: +1 to +4 (e.g., Ambusher, Blood Frenzy)
   - Extra damage on specific attacks (e.g., Charge, Surprise Attack)

2. Defensive Boosts:
   - AC: +1 to +4 (e.g., Avoidance, Constrict, Shadow Stealth)
   - Effective HP: +25% to +100% (e.g., Damage Transfer, Possession)
   - Regeneration: +3 HP per round of regeneration
   - CR-based HP increases (e.g., Relentless, Undead Fortitude)

3. Versatility Boosts:
   - Advantage on specific rolls (e.g., Pack Tactics, Grappler)
   - Extra actions/bonus actions (e.g., Nimble Escape, Multiattack)

4. High-Impact Features:
   - Magic Resistance: +2 to effective AC
   - Superior Invisibility: +2 to effective AC
   - Possession: Double effective HP
   - Nimble Escape: +4 to effective AC and attack bonus

5. Special Considerations:
   - Breath weapons: Assume two targets fail saves
   - Frightful Presence: +25% HP vs. lower-level characters

6. No CR Impact: Flavor abilities (e.g., amphibious, spider climb)

Apply appropriate adjustments based on the monster's unique features.

[Stat Adjustments]
- AC: +/-3
- HP: +/-50% (reduce by expected damage avoided over 3 rounds)
- Atk: +/-2
- Dmg: +/-50% (4x for limited-use, 0.5x for multi-target, 2x for limited multi-target)
- DC: +/-2

[Defensive Considerations]
- Calculate Effective HP: Consider immunities (2x BPS nonmagical), resistances (1.5x BPS nonmagical), and healing
- Calculate Effective AC

[Offensive Considerations]
- Calculate DPR (Damage Per Round)
- Consider attack bonuses and save DCs

[Skill Assignment]
- Higher CR/smarter monsters: More skills (max 4 for most, up to 6 for smart humanoids)
- Large+ bruisers: May have no skills
- Typical monsters: 2 skills (often Perception & Stealth)

[Final CR Calculation]
1. Calculate Offensive CR and Defensive CR separately
2. Average the two CRs for the final CR
3. Adjust based on concept and other details that do not affect CR

Balance adjustments to create the desired concept while maintaining an appropriate challenge level.
