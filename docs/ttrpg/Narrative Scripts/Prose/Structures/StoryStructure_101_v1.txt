# Narrative Structure: "Story Structure 101: Super Basic Shit"

The proposed story structure, referred to as "Story Structure 101: Super Basic Shit," emphasizes the idea of a circular pattern in storytelling. It highlights the importance of a character's journey from their initial comfort zone to an unfamiliar situation and then back to their familiar world, having undergone change. Here's an overview of the structure:

## Act 1: The Setup

1. **Introduction to Character:**
   - The character is introduced in a zone of comfort or familiar environment.
   - Establish the character's goals, desires, or conflicts.

2. **Desire:**
   - The character wants something or has a specific goal.

3. **Entry into an Unfamiliar Situation:**
   - The character enters an unfamiliar or challenging situation related to their desire.

## Act 2: Confrontation

4. **Adaptation:**
   - The character adapts to the new situation, facing obstacles and growing as a result.

5. **Achievement of Desire:**
   - The character succeeds in obtaining what they wanted or achieving their goal.

6. **Heavy Price:**
   - The character pays a heavy price or faces consequences as a result of their actions or choices.

## Act 3: Resolution

7. **Return to Familiar Situation:**
   - The character returns to their original comfort zone or familiar environment.

8. **Change:**
   - The character undergoes a transformation or change, having learned from their experiences.

The structure emphasizes the cyclical nature of stories and the rhythm present in both individual psychology (conscious and unconscious) and society (order and chaos). It suggests that storytelling, when aligned with this pattern, can resonate with audiences on a deep level and provide a journey that reflects the fundamental human experience of growth, change, and returning home.

Please note that this proposed structure serves as a theory or concept rather than a tutorial. It explores the idea that stories inherently follow this pattern and encourages writers to recognize and embrace it in their narratives.
