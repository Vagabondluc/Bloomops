Varied sentence structure and length: Use a mix of short and long sentences, as well as different sentence structures, to create a more engaging and dynamic flow of words
Make the dialogue sound real with common human quirks: craft dialogue that reflects natural speech patterns, but don't overdo slang or sayings.
Use pacing that fits the scene: Use quick, short sentences and paragraphs for exciting or action-filled parts and longer sentences for slower, more introspective scenes.
Maintain a consistent tone: make the tone of the writing consistent throughout the paragraphs, avoiding sudden shifts in formality or style.
Intelligently shuffle and rephrase the text: Alter the sentence structure, introduce synonyms or paraphrase and adjust the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence, as well as the relationships between them, to create subtle variations in the structure of the text.
Avoid using the following words: that, feel/feeling/felt, back, just, then, all, look, maybe, knew/know.
Use strong verbs: Choose powerful action words instead of using adverbs.
Use euphonic words, onomatopoeia, and strong similes: Bring more life to the prose with these but use them sparingly throughout the text.
