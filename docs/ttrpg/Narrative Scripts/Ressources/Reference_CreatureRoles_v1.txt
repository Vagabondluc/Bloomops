Creature roles are a valuable tool for creating engaging and diverse encounters. While incorporating every role into a combat encounter can overly complicate things for most groups, a battle with creatures all sharing the same role can lead to uninteresting, monotonous combat experiences. Few players (or GMs) find satisfaction in combat scenarios where both sides merely exchange blows without any dynamic or dramatic elements. For example, an encounter featuring a controller, a skirmisher, and two soldiers promises more excitement and enjoyment compared to an encounter with four soldiers alone.

Ambusher Creatures
Ambusher creatures possess the ability to hide, become invisible, or vanish from sight during their turns. Typically, they dedicate half of their turn to attacking a player character and the other half to slipping away and concealing themselves. Ambushers prioritize taking down a single character, sometimes dragging their victim into their hidden location. Encounters featuring ambushers should offer plenty of cover to provide hiding spots. Additionally, incorporating other creatures, such as brutes, minions, skirmishers, or soldiers, can keep other player characters occupied while the ambusher focuses on eliminating their chosen target.

Artillery Creatures
Artillery creatures excel in ranged combat, posing a threat to player characters who tend to hang back behind more robust allies. Most artillery creatures are vulnerable in melee, so it's advisable to include brutes, minions, or soldiers that they can use as cover during combat. In battle, artillery creatures usually attempt to distance themselves from nearby foes within a 30-foot radius. They then position a brute, soldier, or another ally between themselves and the threat before launching their attacks. If forced into close combat, most artillery creatures will do whatever they can to disengage and retreat, often using actions like Dash or Disengage. In the absence of immediate threats, artillery creatures move strategically to maintain their distance from player characters while targeting the most significant threat to their allies first.

Brute Creatures
Brute creatures deliver heavy blows and boast substantial hit points. Their damage output demands attention, often causing player characters to prioritize defeating brutes over other foes with fewer hit points or weaker melee capabilities. Brutes are most effective on smaller battlefields, where they can engage multiple enemies simultaneously. In combat, brutes advance toward the nearest group of foes and engage them, preferring to confront multiple adversaries at once. Brutes tend to have simpler mechanics compared to other creatures, making it possible to include a significant number of them in an encounter.

Controller Creatures
Controllers enhance battles by debuffing, hindering, and manipulating player characters. They often possess complex actions and unique traits with distinctive effects, so it's advisable to limit the presence of controllers in most combat encounters to one or two at most. Controllers tend to excel when they are supported and protected by brutes, minions, skirmishers, or soldiers, allowing them to capitalize on the effects they create. Controllers often unleash their most potent effects at the start of an encounter, affecting as many foes as possible. If a controller cannot affect multiple characters or employ their most powerful feature, they focus on repositioning themselves to maximize the impact of their abilities on their next turn.

Leader and Support Creatures
Leader creatures are action-oriented and excel when fighting alongside allies. Support creatures function similarly but lack villainous actions and possess fewer complexities. Both leader and support creatures can summon reinforcements, buff their allies, and provide additional movement and actions. As long as a leader or support creature remains in the fight, their allies benefit from enhanced capabilities. They work most effectively when surrounded by and augmenting artillery, brutes, minions, skirmishers, and soldiers. Typically, it's best to limit the use of one leader or support creature in an encounter, as the overlapping enhancements can transform an ordinary encounter into a deadly one. Leaders and support creatures remain close to their allies to maximize the reach of their beneficial features.

Minion Creatures
Minions, as discussed in the "Minions" section, create cinematic battles where characters feel heroic as they dispatch several foes at a time. Employing minions with a challenge rating within 2 of the characters' average level ensures that they remain dangerous and relevant. When minions collaborate, they cannot be underestimated, as they deliver significant damage and can effectively hinder player characters. Minions excel at protecting ambushers, artillery creatures, controllers, leaders, and support creatures.

Skirmisher Creatures
Skirmisher creatures inject dynamism into battles by targeting vulnerable player characters who are weaker in melee and then retreating, if possible, to safeguard their artillery, controller, leader, and support allies. Their ability to outmaneuver and outpace player characters forces heroes to employ tactical strategies. Skirmishers pair effectively with creatures of all other roles, including fellow skirmishers.

Soldier Creatures
Soldier creatures shield their allies by drawing the attacks of player characters. They excel at protecting ambushers, artillery creatures, controllers, leaders, and support creatures. Soldiers do not need to remain in close proximity to the creatures they protect; in fact, it's often preferable that they do not. A soldier who breaks away from their designated charge can effectively neutralize a threat far from the main battle. During combat, soldiers engage characters proficient in melee, seeking to battle as many foes as they can reach to facilitate the movement of their allies. In encounters featuring multiple soldiers, they typically divide their attention, each confronting a different character.

Solo Creatures
Solo creatures are action-oriented, boasting villainous actions and lair actions that enable them to disrupt and harm foes outside of the standard turn order. They are encountered alone and perform most effectively in environments with ample space and cover options. Solo creatures leverage every available movement advantage, including burrowing, climbing, flying, swimming, or teleporting around the battlefield on their turn. They focus on the character posing the most significant threat while positioning themselves to target as many foes as possible with their area-of-effect abilities.
