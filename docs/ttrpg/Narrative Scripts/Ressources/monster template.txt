## Template System for Modifying Monsters and NPCs

Templates provide a way to modify existing creatures or create variants with specific themes. Below are several templates and transformations you can apply to monsters or NPCs.

### Shadow Dragon Template

Note: To avoid recalculating the creature's challenge rating, apply the template only to a creature that meets the optional prerequisite in the Breath Weapon section. Otherwise, use the guidelines in the Dungeon Master's Guide to recalculate the rating after applying the template.

Additional Powers (choose 2-4 based on the desired power level):

1. Shadow Blend: As a bonus action, the creature can become invisible while in dim light or darkness. The invisibility lasts until the creature moves into bright light, takes an action, or takes damage.

2. Life Drain: The creature's attacks deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. The creature regains hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt.

3. Shadow Jump: As an action, the creature can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is in dim light or darkness.

4. Shadow Puppetry: As an action, the creature can manipulate the shadows of objects within 60 feet, creating minor illusions or causing small objects to move slightly.

5. Fear Aura: Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the shadow creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier) or be frightened until the start of its next turn.

6. Shadow Form: As an action, the creature can transform into a shadow, gaining the amorphous trait and the ability to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. It reverts to its normal form as a bonus action or if it dies.

7. Nightmare Touch: The creature's melee attacks can target a sleeping creature. If hit, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in a nightmare, taking 2d10 psychic damage and gaining no benefit from the rest.

8. Shadow Curse: Once per day, the creature can curse a target it has damaged. The cursed target has disadvantage on saving throws against the shadow creature's abilities and takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage from its attacks. The curse lasts until removed by a remove curse spell or similar magic.

When applying this template, adjust the creature's challenge rating based on the number and power of the additional abilities chosen. Consider the creature's original abilities and how they might be enhanced or altered by its new shadowy nature.

### Using Templates

When applying these templates:
1. Carefully consider the impact on the creature's challenge rating
2. Adjust hit points, AC, and damage output as needed to maintain balance
3. Consider creating unique traits or actions that fit the new theme
4. Ensure the modified creature fits your campaign's tone and challenges

Remember, these templates are guidelines. Feel free to adjust them to better suit your game's needs or to create entirely new templates for other creature types or themes.
