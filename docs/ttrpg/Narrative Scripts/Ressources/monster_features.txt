# Comprehensive Monster Creation Reference

## Base Stat Calculation

1. Choose target CR
2. Calculate base stats using formulas below
3. Adjust for spellcasting (if applicable)
4. Fine-tune stats to fit monster concept
5. Calculate final CR

### Base Stat Formulas

#### CR 0-1/2:
- Atk = 4 + floor(0.5CR)
- DC = 11 + floor(0.5CR)
- AC = 13 + floor(0.33CR)
- Dmg = HP/3
- HP = (ceil(ACCCR) + 1) * 3

#### CR 1-7:
- Atk = 4 + floor(0.5CR)
- DC = 11 + floor(0.5CR)
- AC = 13 + floor(0.33CR)
- Dmg = 5 + 5CR
- HP = 3*Dmg

#### CR 8+:
- Atk = 4 + floor(0.5CR)
- DC = 11 + floor(0.5CR)
- AC = 13 + floor(0.33CR)
- Dmg = 5CR
- HP = 3*Dmg

## Spellcasting Considerations
- Identify spellcasting level and class
- Analyze spell list for strength, atk/dmg, and healing/HP tradeoffs
- Consider a 3-round simulation for spell effects on offensive and defensive CR

## Stat Adjustments
- AC: +/-3
- HP: +/-50% (reduce by expected damage avoided over 3 rounds)
- Atk: +/-2
- Dmg: +/-50% (4x for limited-use, 0.5x for multi-target, 2x for limited multi-target)
- DC: +/-2

## Defensive Considerations
- Calculate Effective HP: Consider immunities (2x BPS nonmagical), resistances (1.5x BPS nonmagical), and healing
- Calculate Effective AC

## Offensive Considerations
- Calculate DPR (Damage Per Round)
- Consider attack bonuses and save DCs

## Skill Assignment
- Higher CR/smarter monsters: More skills (max 4 for most, up to 6 for smart humanoids)
- Large+ bruisers: May have no skills
- Typical monsters: 2 skills (often Perception & Stealth)

## Final CR Calculation
1. Calculate Offensive CR and Defensive CR separately
2. Average the two CRs for the final CR
3. Adjust based on concept and other details that do not affect CR

## Creating NPCs from Scratch

When creating an NPC, you have two main options:

1. Create an NPC stat block similar to those in the Monster Manual, using the monster creation guidelines.
2. Build the NPC as you would a player character, following the rules in the Player's Handbook.

If you choose the second option, you can skip selecting a background and instead choose two skill proficiencies for the NPC.

### Using Non-Human Races and Low CR Creatures as NPCs

The table below summarizes ability modifiers and features for various non-human races and creatures with a challenge rating lower than 1. Apply these modifiers and features to the NPC's stat block, then determine the NPC's challenge rating as you would for a monster. 

Note: The NPC's proficiency bonus is determined by its level, like a character, rather than by its challenge rating.

*See the Player's Handbook for descriptions of this race's features, none of which alter the NPC's challenge rating.

### Important Notes:
1. Features that can affect a monster's challenge rating are listed in the Monster Features table earlier in this reference.
2. If you want to use a monster that isn't listed here, refer to the "Monsters with Classes" section in the Dungeon Master's Guide.
3. When creating NPCs using these guidelines, remember to balance their abilities and challenge rating to fit your campaign and encounter needs.
4. You can mix and match features from different races or creatures to create unique NPCs, but be mindful of how this might affect their overall power and challenge rating.

Remember to use these guidelines as a starting point and adjust as needed to create compelling and balanced NPCs for your game.
