# Dungeon Concept Brainstormer

## Objective
Generate a compelling scenario concept for a dungeon adventure by brainstorming key elements.

## Instructions
1. Start with three core components:
   - Location
   - Denizens
   - Goal

2. Choose a focus element:
   - If you have a location in mind, use it to determine denizens and goal
   - If you have denizens, use them to inspire location and goal
   - If you have a goal, use it to suggest location and denizens

3. Brainstorming Techniques:
   - Monster Manual Scan: Flip through creature lists for inspiration
   - Creature Pairing: Combine two different types of creatures
   - Location Twist: Take a real-world location and add a fantastical element
   - Magic Item Motivation: Use a powerful artifact as the central goal

4. Develop Connections:
   - Explain why chosen denizens are in the location
   - Determine how the goal relates to both location and denizens

5. Generate Room Ideas:
   - List 5-10 unique room concepts related to your scenario
   - Include both logical necessities and fantastical elements

6. Refine Concept:
   - Ensure all elements (location, denizens, goal, rooms) form a cohesive whole
   - Adjust any components that don't fit the overall theme

7. Record Final Concept:
   - Write a brief paragraph summarizing the dungeon concept
   - List key points for location, denizens, goal, and unique features
