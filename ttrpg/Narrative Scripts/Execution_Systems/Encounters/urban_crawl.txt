Urban Crawl Creation Guidelines for an LLM:

1. Overview and Purpose:
   - As the LLM, your role is to create an urban crawl that leverages the city gazetteer to provide a structured, exploratory campaign experience for the player characters.
   - The urban crawl treats the city as the core focus, with the player characters investigating and engaging with the various layers of content keyed to the different districts.

2. Keying Districts:
   - Review the city gazetteer and identify key locations, scenarios, and narrative elements that can be tied to each district.
   - These keyed elements can include:
     - Standalone scenes or short scenarios (e.g., a vampire den, a gang conflict, a political debate)
     - Ongoing storylines or faction-based activities (e.g., a heist plot, a missing persons investigation, a patron offering jobs)
     - Points of interest, NPCs, or adventure sites that can serve as hooks for further exploration

3. Layered Content:
   - Consider organizing the keyed district content into thematic "layers" or metascenarios.
   - Examples of potential layers include:
     - Vampire blood den activities
     - Noir gang operations
     - Opportunities for lucrative heists
     - Patrons offering jobs or quests
     - Potential contacts or allies to be recruited
   - Maintain a "base layer" of general content that doesn't fit into a specific citywide theme.
   - Layers can be added, retired, or expanded as the campaign progresses.

4. Investigation Actions:
   - Establish the investigation action as the primary means for player characters to access the keyed district content.
   - When the players state they want to investigate a specific district, resolve it as follows:
     - If they are investigating a general layer, randomly or arbitrarily determine which layer's content they encounter.
     - If they are investigating a specific layer or storyline, pull the relevant content from that layer.
   - Investigate actions can have mechanical components, such as skill checks or costs, depending on the layer being accessed.

5. Triggered Districts:
   - Some districts may have content that automatically triggers when the players enter the area, without requiring a separate investigation action.
   - Treat these triggered districts similarly to random encounters, with the content engaging the players immediately upon arrival.
   - The distinction between triggered districts and random encounters can be fluid, so use whichever approach works best for the specific content.

6. Running the Urban Crawl:
   - Seamlessly integrate the urban crawl into the broader campaign structure, allowing the players to move between districts, engage in downtime activities, and respond to faction actions.
   - Use the city gazetteer and "Life in the City" procedures to describe the players' journeys between districts, including scenic encounters along the way.
   - When the players initiate an investigation action, resolve it based on the keyed content and the specific layer they are engaging with.
   - Be prepared to adapt and expand the urban crawl as the campaign progresses, introducing new layers, evolving existing storylines, and responding to the players' choices and interests.
