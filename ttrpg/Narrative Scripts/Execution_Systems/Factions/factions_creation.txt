Faction Creation Guidelines for an LLM:

1. Overview and Purpose:
   - As the LLM, your role is to create factions - groups or organizations with their own agendas, beliefs, and goals - that will populate the urban campaign world.
   - Factions are crucial in adding depth, intrigue, and a sense of an active, living city beyond just the player characters (PCs).

2. Faction Types:
   - Factions can encompass a wide variety of groups, including government agencies, religious orders, military factions, criminal syndicates, artisan guilds, secret societies, and more.
   - Aim to create a diverse mix of faction types to avoid a homogenous city environment.
   - Include at least one rival faction for each faction you create to foster competition and conflict.

3. Faction Preparation:
   a. Short Description:
      - Prepare a 1-2 paragraph description summarizing the faction's nature, goals, and notable details.

   b. Faction Tier:
      - Assign the faction a tier level (1-4) based on their power and influence, using the provided D&D Faction Tier Table.
      - This tier will determine their proficiency bonus for any faction-related checks.

   c. Faction Leadership:
      - Identify the faction's leader(s) - whether a single individual or a small council.
      - Provide a brief 1-2 sentence description of the leader(s).

   d. Faction Agents:
      - Create 2-3 distinct faction agents or operatives the PCs are likely to interact with.
      - Develop these agents' personalities, skills, and potential roles within the faction.

   e. Allies and Enemies:
      - Determine at least one faction that is allied with the one you're creating.
      - Also identify at least one faction that is an enemy or rival of this faction.

   f. Faction Clocks:
      - Establish 1-3 faction clocks representing the faction's current agendas and activities.
      - Each clock should have 4, 6, or 8 segments, depending on the complexity of the project.

5. Ongoing Faction Management:
   - As the campaign progresses, be prepared to introduce new factions, phase out less relevant ones, and expand on the factions the PCs interact with the most.
   - Maintain a balance of 4-8 active factions to track at any given time.
