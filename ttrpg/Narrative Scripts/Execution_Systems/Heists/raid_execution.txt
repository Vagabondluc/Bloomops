Raid Running Guidelines for an LLM:

1. Introduction to Raids:
   - Raids are a type of high-stakes, tactical scenario that challenge players to survey a secure location, formulate a plan, and execute a coordinated assault.
   - To introduce the concept of a raid to players:
     - The patron who hires the players can provide suggestions or explicit directions on how to approach the job.
     - The first raid scenario can feature an ultra-trivial survey, automatically providing the players with a complete set of blueprints and security details.
     - Equipment provided to the players, such as tools for stealth or breaching, can guide them towards a raid-style approach.
   - Once players understand the raid framework, they will naturally start looking for opportunities to employ these tactics in future scenarios.

2. Failing Forward:
   - The failing forward technique prevents failed skill checks from completely derailing the players' intended plans.
   - When a check fails, describe the success with a complication, such as:
     - Triggering an alarm
     - Damaging equipment
     - Alerting security forces
   - Offer the players the option to pay a cost to succeed, or accept the complication.
   - Failing forward is particularly useful in raids, as it allows tactical plans to survive contact with the enemy and introduces complications that can create dynamic, escalating situations.

3. "Let It Ride" Checks:
   - Avoid rolling to failure by allowing a single skill check to determine the overall success or failure of a broad attempt.
   - Permit the players' choices and actions to intersect with the riding check, providing opportunities for bonuses, penalties, or changes in approach or circumstance.
   - Identify when a riding check should end due to success, failure, a change of approach, or a significant change in circumstances.
   - This approach prevents the players' intended actions from being repeatedly undermined by multiple skill checks.

4. The Theater of Operations:
   - Expand your scope beyond the immediate room or area, considering the interconnected nature of the raid location.
   - Track the neighboring rooms, hallways, and areas that may become relevant as the players navigate the environment and encounter opposition.
   - Use the adversary roster and line of sight to determine which areas should be included in your active "theater of operations" at any given moment.
   - Avoid prepping specific "theaters of operations" ahead of time, instead allowing the dynamic situation to define the relevant areas.
   - This allows for more dynamic, strategic decision-making and combat encounters that make use of the full environment.

5. Raid Turn Procedure:
   a. Mark Ticks:
      - Track the passage of time using 1-minute raid turns.

   b. Activation Checks:
      - Determine which passive action groups become active through patrols, complications, or activation checks.
      - Use either a site activation check or a group activation check to trigger activations.

   c. Adversary Actions:
      - Categorize action groups as Active, Alert, or Aware to efficiently manage their responses.
      - Apply perception penalties based on distance or obstructions when determining if action groups become aware of the players.
      - Determine appropriate actions for adversaries, such as attacking, fleeing, or seeking assistance.

   d. Perception Checks:
      - Call for Perception-type checks to determine if action groups notice evidence of the players' activities.
      - Factor in distance penalties and the current status of the action groups (Active, Alert, Aware) when setting DCs.

   e. Resolving Actions:
      - Manage the players' movements, actions, and reactions within the 1-minute raid turn structure.
      - Incorporate the "theater of operations" approach to allow for dynamic, interconnected encounters.
