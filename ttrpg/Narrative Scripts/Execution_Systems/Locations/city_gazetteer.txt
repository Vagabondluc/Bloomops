City Gazetteer Creation Guidelines for an LLM:

1. Overview and Purpose:
   - As the LLM, your role is to create a detailed city gazetteer to support an urban campaign setting.
   - The gazetteer serves as an encyclopedic reference for the city, complementing the city map and providing depth and texture to the environment.

2. City Map and Transportation:
   a. Entry and Exit Points:
      - Identify the primary ways that characters can enter and leave the city, such as major roads, waterways, airship docks, or transportation hubs.
      - Describe the key features and significance of these entry/exit points.

   b. Intra-City Transportation:
      - Determine the major routes and thoroughfares that connect the various districts of the city.
      - Note the names and characteristics of these connecting roads, including prominent landmarks, mode of transportation, and potential obstacles.
      - Detail any advanced transportation systems, such as subterranean tunnels, aerial cable cars, or magical transportation methods.

   c. District Connections:
      - For each district, describe how characters can travel to and from it using the major routes.
      - Provide specific directions or guidance, noting any unique transportation methods or challenges specific to certain districts.

3. District Descriptions:
   - Prepare a description for each district or major neighborhood in the city.
   - Include details about the district's general character, such as predominant businesses, architecture, ethnic demographics, and noteworthy history.

4. Landmark Entries:
   - Create entries for 3-5 notable landmarks within each district.
   - Landmarks can include prominent buildings, public spaces, businesses, or other locations of interest.
   - For each landmark, provide a brief description highlighting its significance, unique features, and potential relevance to the campaign.

5. City Services:
   - Compile a list of common services available within the city, such as inns, shops, banks, medical facilities, and entertainment venues.
   - For each service category, include 2-3 distinct options, describing their quality, cost, and other distinguishing factors.

6. Adventure Sites:
   - Note any specific adventure locations, dungeons, or other points of interest within the city.
   - Determine which of these sites warrant a full entry in the gazetteer, based on their importance or likelihood of being explored by the player characters.
   - Provide details about the nature, history, and potential significance of these adventure sites.

7. Scenic Encounters:
   a. Purpose of Scenic Encounters:
      - Scenic encounters are used to create a sense of constant activity and life within the city, providing small slices of local color and incidental interactions.
      - They contribute to the impression that the city is a bustling, living environment beyond just the player characters' immediate activities.

   b. Encounter Types:
      - Scenic encounters should not involve hostile or combat-oriented encounters, but rather focus on everyday events, interactions, and observations.
      - Examples include lost travelers, street vendors, arguments between locals, unusual sights or sounds, minor criminal activities, and other slice-of-life moments.

   c. Encounter Preparation:
      - Prepare a table of 20-30 potential scenic encounters that can be used across the various districts of the city.
      - Alternatively, create separate encounter tables for each district, customizing the encounters to fit the district's unique character and demographics.
      - For each encounter, prepare a brief description that can be easily incorporated into the narrative when the encounter is triggered.

   d. Encounter Deployment:
      - As the player characters travel through the city, periodically check for a scenic encounter by rolling a d6 (or other appropriate die).
      - On a result of 1, a scenic encounter occurs, which the LLM can then describe and introduce into the scene.
      - Scenic encounters can be placed at landmarks, district entry points, or along the route the characters are taking.

8. Background Events:
   a. Purpose of Background Events:
      - Background events are a separate timeline of ongoing occurrences in the campaign world that do not directly involve the player characters.
      - They provide depth and a sense of a living, persistent world beyond the characters' immediate activities.

   b. Event Types:
      - Background events can include local news, regional or global happenings, cultural developments, and other noteworthy occurrences.
      - Examples include political elections, scientific breakthroughs, natural disasters, cultural events, and other significant events that are shaping the campaign world.

   c. Event Presentation:
      - Background events can be presented to the players in various ways, such as newspaper headlines, overheard conversations, television/radio broadcasts, or information gleaned from NPCs.
      - These events can serve as backdrops for the characters' adventures, provide context and foreshadowing, or potentially lead to the players pursuing further investigation.

   d. Ongoing Maintenance:
      - Maintain a separate list of background events, updating it regularly as the campaign progresses.
      - Periodically transfer relevant background events from this list to the campaign status document to ensure they are incorporated into the ongoing narrative.

9. Gazetteer Entry Template:
   Each entry in the city gazetteer should follow a consistent format, such as:

   District Name:
   Description:
     - General character and features of the district
   Transportation:
     - Entry/exit points
     - Major routes and connections to other districts
   Landmarks:
     - Landmark 1 Name:
       - Description
     - Landmark 2 Name:
       - Description
   Services:
     - Service 1 Name:
       - Description
     - Service 2 Name:
       - Description
   Adventure Sites:
     - Site 1 Name:
       - Description
   Scenic Encounters:
     - Encounter 1 Description
     - Encounter 2 Description

10. Ongoing Gazetteer Expansion:
    - As the campaign progresses, be prepared to expand the city gazetteer by adding new district descriptions, landmark entries, service options, adventure sites, and scenic encounters.
    - The city gazetteer should serve as a living document, evolving alongside the campaign and the PCs' interactions with the city.
    - Maintain a separate archive of previous versions of the gazetteer to ensure no relevant information is lost.
