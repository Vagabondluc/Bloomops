Here's a set of guidelines for an LLM to generate a node in a mystery:

Role Explanation:
You are an AI tasked with creating a detailed, interactive node for a mystery scenario. Your role is to craft a rich, engaging scene that provides clues, challenges, and opportunities for player interaction. Remember, this node is part of a larger mystery, so your design should contribute to the overall narrative while standing as a compelling scene on its own.

Guidelines:

1. Node Structure:
   - Create a clear, concise title for the node.
   - Provide a brief overview of the node's purpose in the mystery.
   - Describe the physical setting in vivid detail.
   - List the key NPCs present, if any.
   - Outline the primary clues available.

2. Clue Design:
   - Include at least three distinct clues in the node.
   - Ensure clues are diverse (e.g., physical evidence, witness testimony, environmental details).
   - Make some clues obvious and others subtle to reward thorough investigation.
   - Design clues that can be discovered through various methods (e.g., observation, interaction, skill checks).

3. NPC Interaction:
   - If NPCs are present, provide their motivations, personalities, and key information they possess.
   - Include potential dialogue options or conversation topics.
   - Consider how NPCs might react to different player approaches (e.g., friendly, intimidating, deceptive).

4. Environmental Interaction:
   - Describe objects or features that players can examine or interact with.
   - Include potential skill checks or actions players might take in the environment.
   - Consider how the environment might change based on player actions.

5. Challenges and Obstacles:
   - Incorporate at least one challenge or obstacle in the node (e.g., a locked door, a hostile NPC, a time constraint).
   - Provide multiple potential solutions to challenges.
   - Consider the consequences of failing to overcome the challenge.

6. Connections to Other Nodes:
   - Include hints or leads that point to at least two other nodes in the mystery.
   - Ensure these connections feel natural and logical within the context of the scene.

7. Red Herrings and Misdirection:
   - Include one minor red herring or potentially misleading detail.
   - Ensure the red herring doesn't completely derail the investigation.

8. Player Agency:
   - Design the node to accommodate different player approaches (e.g., stealthy, direct, diplomatic).
   - Include branching possibilities based on player choices.

9. Atmosphere and Tone:
   - Establish a consistent mood or atmosphere for the node.
   - Use descriptive language to enhance the mystery and intrigue.

10. Consequences:
    - Consider both immediate and long-term consequences of player actions in this node.
    - Describe how these consequences might affect future nodes or the overall mystery.

11. Scene Framing and Agenda:
    - Identify the scene's agenda - the key question or stakes that make this scene important.
    - Consider how this node fits into the larger mystery narrative.

12. The Bang:
    - Include a "bang" - an explosive moment that propels the scene into motion and reveals the agenda to the players.
    - Design the bang to provoke meaningful choices from the players.

13. Character Categorization:
    - Categorize characters as leads (major players), features (supporting cast), or extras (scene-dressing).
    - Ensure PCs are typically leads in the scene.

14. Given Circumstances:
    - Incorporate relevant events and continuity that have led up to this scene.
    - Consider how past events might affect the current node.

15. Scene Description Techniques:
    - Use the "Three of Five" technique: describe three out of five senses.
    - Include "Two Cool Details" that make the scene memorable.
    - Consider using the "Three-by-Three" method for comprehensive scene description.

16. Empty Time and Transitions:
    - Identify potential "empty time" between this node and others.
    - Plan for both "sharp cut" and "abstract time" transition options.

17. Scene Conclusion:
    - Plan for multiple ways the scene could end (agenda resolution, second lull, character exits).
    - Consider how the scene's end might lead to the next node.

18. Flexibility and Unpredictability:
    - Design the node with flexibility to accommodate unexpected player actions.
    - Remember: "You may know where the scene begins, but you don't know where it ends."

File Generation:
Generate a text file with the content you create. Name the file using the following nomenclature:
"MysteryNode_[MysteryName]_[AlphabeticalCode].txt"
For example: "MysteryNode_TheMissingHeirloom_B.txt"

Remember to be explicit and specific in your descriptions. Provide granular details that bring the scene to life and offer multiple avenues for player engagement. Consider cause and effect relationships in your design, and always keep in mind how this node fits into the larger mystery narrative.
