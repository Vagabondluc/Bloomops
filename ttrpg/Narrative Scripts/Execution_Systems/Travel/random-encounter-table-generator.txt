2. List Potential Encounters:
   - Include creatures from dungeon's main denizens
   - Add environmental hazards or events
   - Consider neutral or potentially friendly encounters

   - Include number and type of creatures (e.g., "2d4 goblins")
   - Note any special conditions or equipment

5. Add Encounter Distance:
   - Include method for determining encounter distance (e.g., 2d6 x 10 feet)

6. Include Reaction Check:
   - Add instructions for reaction rolls
   - Provide reaction table (2d6: 2-3 Hostile, 4-6 Unfriendly, 7-9 Neutral, 10-12 Friendly)

7. Special Instructions:
   - Note any specific rules for running encounters
   - Include guidelines for scaling difficulty

8. Format Table:
   - Create clear, easy-to-read table
   - Include die roll, encounter description, and any additional notes

9. Test and Refine:
   - Roll on table several times to ensure variety and balance
   - Adjust as needed based on test results
