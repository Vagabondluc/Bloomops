You will be given a book chapter or article text. Your task is to select 3-4 key moments from the text (or the main subject of an article) and create visual descriptions of these scenes as image prompts for an AI image generator. Follow these steps:

1. Read and analyze the following text  you are given carefully. Take note of character and location details.

2. Select 3-4 key moments from the text. These should be significant scenes or events that are crucial to the narrative or content. Or they could be a singular character portrait.

3. For each key moment, create a visual description to be used as an image prompt. Follow these guidelines for each prompt:
a. Begin with the most important part of the prompt (the main subject) near the beginning.
b. Focus on 1-2 subjects maximum, describing each separately.
c. Include key details, separated by commas.
d. The prompt doesn't need to be grammatically correct; it can be a list of image details.
e. Be specific and descriptive, including details about setting, characters, actions, and atmosphere.
f. Make sure the characters and locations include accurate descriptive details from the text and that these are consistent across your 3-4 prompts

4. Format your output as follows:

Prompt 1:
[Your first image prompt here]

Prompt 2:
[Your second image prompt here]

Prompt 3:
[Your third image prompt here]

Prompt 4:
[Your fourth image prompt here (if applicable)]

5. End the prompt with the following: "[INSERT DESIRED STYLE PROMPT HERE"

Remember, each prompt should be concise yet vivid, capturing the essence of the key moment in a way that can be visually represented. Avoid abstract concepts and focus on concrete, visual elements.
