Swarm Characteristics:
The mob can occupy another creature's space and move through any opening large enough for a [Original Size] [Creature_Type]. The mob can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

Size Reduction and Token Dynamics:
- Gargantuan: [Base HP] x 16
- Huge: [Base HP] x 9
- Large: [Base HP] x 4
- Medium: [Base HP]

For every [Damage Threshold for Token Loss] points of damage, the mob loses tokens, reducing the mob's size and damage output accordingly. Size transitions occur when the mob's hit points fall below the next threshold.

Actions:

- Primary Melee Attack (Group Attack): [Attack Type]: +[To Hit from Creature], reach [as appropriate], multiple targets.
  - Gargantuan: Hit: [Base Damage] x 4
  - Huge: Hit: [Base Damage] x 3
  - Large: Hit: [Base Damage] x 2
  - Medium: Hit: [Base Damage]

- Primary Ranged Attack (Group Attack converted to Saving Throw):
  - Gargantuan: [Save DC] = 8 + [Proficiency Bonus] + [Creature's DEX or other relevant modifier], Damage: [Base Ranged Damage] x 4 on a failed save, half on a successful one.
  - Huge: [Save DC] as above, Damage: [Base Ranged Damage] x 3 on a failed save, half on a successful one.
  - Large: [Save DC] as above, Damage: [Base Ranged Damage] x 2 on a failed save, half on a successful one.

Challenge Rating (CR):
Adjust CR based on the difficulty level of the mob and the number of hit points. Use the D&D guidelines to estimate the CR for a mob.

(Note: The CR estimation should be refined based on playtesting and the actual challenge the mob presents during gameplay.)
