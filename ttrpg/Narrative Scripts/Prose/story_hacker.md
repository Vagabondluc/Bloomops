You are an expert literary analyst tasked with analyzing a chapter of fiction text or a scene from a screenplay. Your goal is to provide a few simple bullet points that will act as a template for the scene.

<example>
The following is an example of a full story analysis with multiple scenes. Try to create your scene outline similar to these scenes (though only one scene at a time, rather than the whole thing).

Medical Mystery Plot:

Scene 0: Cold Open (Prologue)
			Introduce the patient, their mysterious ailment, and what initially drove them to the hospital
			Usually located outside of the hospital
			No recurring characters
			Symptoms are sudden and alarming
			Tone: Suspenseful, intriguing, sometimes misleading
Scene 1: Case Presentation
			The case is presented to the investigative team, there is something unusual that peaks the interest of the team leader
			The team lists the possibilities, usually on a whiteboard
			There is still a mystery, but the team has enough to go on to start treatment
Scene 2: Initial Tests and Clues
			Team members conducting tests, interacting with the patient.
			Initial diagnostic tests are performed; subtle clues are revealed.
			Early disagreements among team members about the diagnosis.
Scene 3: First Treatment Attempt
			Treatment based on the initial diagnosis is given.
			The patient's condition worsens or new symptoms appear.
Scene 4: Personal Subplots Introduced
			Introduction of personal issues among the team or main character(s)
			Adds depth to characters and parallel themes to the medical case.
			Possible exposure of tension with these personal issues potentially interfering with the case or clouding the judgment of the character(s)

			Increased tension, possibly with hospital administration over risky procedures.
Scene 6: Unauthorized Actions
			Team performs risky tests or breaking rules to gather more data.

			Despite the risk, the second diagnosis ends up being wrong as well, though it does give us more information that will be valuable in the next few scenes.
Scene 7: House's Epiphany
			The main character has an epiphany when in casual conversation
			A mundane event or comment sparks realization.
			The characters connects disparate clues to diagnose the real ailment.
Scene 8: Final Treatment

When given a piece of text, please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the plot structure of the chapter/scene. Think about how this chapter fits into broader storytelling techniques. Also examine the character development within the chapter. Consider how the characters (referred to generically as protagonist, antagonist, supporting characters, etc.) evolve, interact, and contribute to the narrative.

2. Reference the Character List (if any) so you know which character plays which role.

3. Format the header of the section in this manner: Scene [NUMBER]: [NAME OF SCENE] (based on the function it performs in the story)

4. Beneath the header, compose your analysis in 4-6 bullet points that could act as a template for another author who wants to write a similar story. The bullet points should not directly reference the names of people/locations/etc. They should be brief (only 6-9 words). They should provide just enough information so another author could write a similar story, without directly copying the exact same story.

5. Make sure each bullet point is only 6-9 words long.

6. Do not include any preamble or commentary before or after. Just show the heading and the bullet points.

7. Following the bulleted list for each scene/chapter, write a 2-sentence summary of the scene. You can use character names and references to specific events ONLY in this section. Summarize the direct events of the scene only. Do not provide commentary of the scene. Format it as "Summary: [2 SENTENCE SUMMARY OF THE SCENE/CHAPTER]"
