# 5th Edition D&D Monster Templates Guide

## What is a Template?

A template is a set of modifications that can be applied to an existing creature to create a new variant with specific themes or abilities. Templates allow Dungeon Masters to quickly customize monsters or NPCs, adding depth and variety to their game without creating entirely new creatures from scratch.

## How to Apply a Template

1. Choose a base creature to modify.
2. Select an appropriate template.
3. Apply the changes specified in the template to the base creature's statistics.
4. Add new features, actions, or traits as described in the template.
5. Recalculate the creature's Challenge Rating based on its new abilities and stats.

## Anatomy of a Template

A typical template includes:

1. **Prerequisite**: Conditions that must be met for the template to be applied.
2. **Type**: Any changes to the creature's type (e.g., from humanoid to undead).
3. **Ability Score Changes**: Modifications to the creature's ability scores.
4. **New Senses**: Additional senses the creature gains.
5. **New Skills**: Any skill proficiencies the creature acquires.
6. **Damage Resistances/Immunities/Vulnerabilities**: Changes to the creature's damage interactions.
7. **Condition Immunities**: New conditions the creature becomes immune to.
8. **New Features**: Special abilities or traits the creature gains.
9. **New Actions**: Additional actions the creature can take.

## Dealing with Conflicting Monster Features

When a template grants a feature that conflicts with an existing feature of the base creature:

1. Use the higher value for numerical bonuses.
2. Keep both features if they provide different benefits.
3. Replace the existing feature if the new one is strictly better.
4. Use your discretion as DM to decide which fits better thematically.

## Functional Templates vs. Class Templates

**Functional Templates** modify a creature to fit a specific role or theme, such as "undead commander" or "fey-touched being." They often change fundamental aspects of the creature, including its type or core abilities.

**Class Templates** add features and abilities based on player character classes. They typically grant class features, spellcasting abilities, or other powers associated with a particular class, allowing you to create NPC versions of class archetypes.

Both types of templates provide ways to customize creatures, but they approach it from different angles - one focusing on thematic modifications, the other on class-based enhancements.

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature of 9th level or higher

Death Knights are fallen warriors who have been granted a terrible form of undeath, either as punishment for their misdeeds or as a reward for their service to dark powers. These formidable combatants retain all of their martial skill from life, now enhanced by necromantic energies that allow them to bolster undead allies and strike fear into the hearts of the living. Death Knights are often found leading armies of the undead or serving as the elite guard for powerful liches or vampire lords.

This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

## Death Master

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature with spellcasting ability

Death Masters are the pinnacle of necromantic power, individuals who have delved so deeply into the secrets of death that they stand at the threshold between life and the grave. These sinister spellcasters command legions of undead, raising fallen foes to serve them and using necromantic energy to devastate their enemies. Death Masters often seek to unlock the secrets of immortality, viewing undeath as the ultimate form of existence. Their lairs are grim places filled with the remnants of their dark experiments and the mindless undead that serve them.

**Changes:**
- Gain resistance to necrotic damage.
- Gain proficiency in the Arcana and Religion skills.

Each creature within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 6d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead creatures the death master controls are unaffected by this burst.

## Demagogue

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature with Charisma 13 or higher

Demagogues are charismatic leaders who possess an uncanny ability to sway the masses through their words and presence. They can incite riots with a whisper or quell uprisings with a gesture, their influence over others bordering on the supernatural.

Their followers display a fanatical devotion, willing to sacrifice everything for their leader's cause.

**Changes:**

While charmed, the target regards the demagogue's words as absolute truth and will carry out any verbal commands the demagogue gives that don't cause direct harm to the target.

## Demonic Acolyte

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature with spellcasting ability

Demonic Acolytes are mortals who have pledged their souls to demon lords, gaining infernal powers in exchange for their servitude. These corrupted individuals serve as the intermediaries between the mortal realm and the Abyss, leading cults dedicated to their demonic patrons. Demonic Acolytes undergo physical and spiritual transformations as they delve deeper into abyssal magic, their bodies warping to reflect their inner corruption.

## Devastator

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature with spellcasting ability

Devastators are the epitome of destructive magic, spellcasters who have honed their craft for the singular purpose of wreaking havoc on the battlefield. These individuals can unleash barrages of elemental fury, shatter defenses with a word, and reduce entire formations to ash with a gesture. Devastators are highly sought after by armies and often serve as living weapons of mass destruction. Their presence in a conflict can shift the balance of power dramatically, as few conventional defenses can withstand their arcane onslaught.

**Changes:**
- Increase Intelligence score by 2 (maximum 20).
- Gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.
- Add the following features:
  - **Arcane Recovery** (1/Day): When the devastator finishes a short rest, it can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half the devastator's level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
  - **Sculpt Spells**: When the devastator casts an evocation spell that affects other creatures that it can see, it can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level.

- Add the following actions:
  - **Arcane Burst** (Recharge 5-6): The devastator releases a burst of raw magical energy. Each creature in a 20-foot radius must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Feyborn

**Prerequisite:** Any beast or humanoid creature

Feyborn are mortals who have been touched by the wild magic of the Feywild, their very essence altered by prolonged exposure to this realm of chaos and beauty. These individuals straddle the line between the mortal world and the fey realms, possessing an otherworldly allure and unpredictable nature. Feyborn often exhibit physical changes that hint at their connection to the Feywild, such as vibrant hair colors, shimmering skin, or eyes that change color with their mood. Their innate connection to fey magic grants them abilities that blur the lines between reality and illusion.

**Changes:**
- The creature gains the fey type in addition to its other types.
- Increase Charisma score by 2 (maximum 20).

- Add the following actions:
  - **Fey Charm**: The feyborn targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the feyborn, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 minute. The charmed creature regards the feyborn as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the feyborn's control, it takes the feyborn's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.
  - **Glamour Weaving** (1/Day): The feyborn magically weaves an illusion to alter its appearance or that of up to three willing creatures within 30 feet. Each target can appear up to 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. The illusion can't change a target's body type, so each target must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. The illusion lasts for 8 hours or until the feyborn uses this feature again.

## Frost Adept

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature with spellcasting ability

Frost Adepts are individuals who have forged a deep connection with the elemental power of ice and cold. These winter-touched beings can conjure blizzards with a thought, shape ice into deadly weapons, and freeze their foes solid with a touch. Frost Adepts are often found in arctic regions, serving as guardians of ancient glacial temples or as the champions of primordial ice elementals. Their presence can dramatically alter local weather patterns, bringing unseasonable cold and frost wherever they go.

The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature in the area when the blizzard appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The blizzard lasts for 1 minute or until the frost adept uses a bonus action to end it.

## Lich

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid spellcaster of 17th level or higher

Liches are the ultimate expression of the necromancer's art, spellcasters who have conquered death through dark rituals and the creation of a phylactery to house their soul. These undead archmages possess vast magical power and knowledge accumulated over centuries of unlife. Liches are driven by an insatiable hunger for arcane secrets and power, often conducting horrific experiments and amassing vast libraries of forbidden lore. Their very presence can warp reality, and the areas around their lairs often become warped by necromantic energies.

  - **Frightening Gaze**: The lich targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. If the target can see the lich, it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute.

If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lich's gaze for the next 24 hours.

## Mummy Lord

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature of 13th level or higher

Mummy Lords are the preserved remains of ancient rulers or high priests, sustained through powerful necromantic rituals to serve as eternal guardians. These undead lords retain much of their knowledge and power from life, enhanced by the dark magics that animate them.

A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy lords for the next 24 hours.
  - **Blasphemous Word** (1/Day): The mummy lord utters a blasphemous word. Each non-undead creature within 10 feet of the mummy lord that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the mummy lord's next turn.

## Mummy Champion

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature of 7th level or higher

Mummy Champions are the elite warriors of ancient cultures, preserved through sacred mummification rites to serve as eternal protectors. Unlike their priestly counterparts, Mummy Champions retain their martial prowess, combining it with necromantic durability and divine wrath.

The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.
  - **Command Undead** (1/Day): The mummy champion targets up to three undead creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall under the mummy champion's control for 24 hours.

## Savage Berserker

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature

Savage Berserkers are warriors who have tapped into primal fury, channeling rage and bloodlust to become unstoppable forces on the battlefield. These individuals eschew armor and finesse in favor of raw power and aggression, often entering a trance-like state of battle frenzy.

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature with spellcasting ability

Scions of Flame are individuals who have forged a deep connection with elemental fire, either through arcane study, divine blessing, or exposure to powerful fire elementals. These living embodiments of flame can conjure and control fire at will, their very presence raising the temperature of their surroundings.

The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the scion's concentration ends. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. One side of the wall deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

## Shadowborn Stalker

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature

Shadowborn Stalkers are individuals who have been touched by the essence of the Shadowfell, granting them supernatural stealth and control over darkness. These enigmatic figures can meld with shadows, teleport through darkened areas, and strike with the swiftness of a flickering shadow. Shadowborn Stalkers often serve as elite assassins, spies, or thieves, their abilities making them nearly impossible to detect or capture. Their prolonged exposure to the Shadowfell often leaves them with a grim outlook and an affinity for darkness that unnerves even their allies.

  - **Envelope in Darkness** (1/Day): The shadowborn stalker magically creates an area of darkness in a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 60 feet. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. The darkness lasts for 10 minutes or until the shadowborn stalker dismisses it as an action.

## Vampire Lord

**Prerequisite:** Any humanoid creature of 11th level or higher

Vampire Lords are the apex predators of the undead world, having mastered their bloodlust and unlocked the full potential of their vampiric powers. These charismatic and terrifying individuals possess supernatural strength, speed, and charm, able to enthrall mortals with a glance and heal grievous wounds by feeding on the living. Vampire Lords often rule over networks of lesser vampires and thralls, building shadow empires that span generations. Their immortality and cunning make them patient and dangerous foes, capable of orchestrating schemes that unfold over centuries.

**Changes:**
- The creature's type changes to undead.
- Increase Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma scores by 2 (maximum 20).
- Gain resistance to necrotic damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
- Gain the following weaknesses: sunlight hypersensitivity, running water, stake to the heart, invitation only.
- Add the following features:
  - **Regeneration**: The vampire lord regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire lord takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire lord's next turn.
  - **Shapechanger**: If the vampire lord isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat, a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. While in bat form, the vampire lord can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. While in mist form, the vampire lord can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. If air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.
- Add the following actions:
  - **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire lord, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire lord regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire lord's control.
  - **Charm**: The vampire lord targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire lord, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire lord. The charmed target regards the vampire lord as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire lord's control, it takes the vampire lord's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire lord's bite attack. Each time the vampire lord or the vampire lord's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire lord is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.
  - **Children of the Night** (1/Day): The vampire lord magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire lord can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire lord and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire lord dies, or until the vampire lord dismisses them as a bonus action.



  # 5th Edition D&D Class Monster Templates

# 5th Edition D&D Class Templates Guide

Class templates allow you to add features of a specific character class to a monster or NPC. The following templates represent the classes in the Player's Handbook.

Adding a class to an existing monster is a matter of overlaying the appropriate template. If you want to advance the monster in a class, first adjust its Challenge Rating (CR) as desired, then add the relevant class template.

This method works best with existing monster stat blocks. Use the rules for creating new monsters if you are adding class levels to creatures of your own design.

If the effect of a class feature depends on level, such as a cleric's Channel Divinity, use the monster's CR as its effective level. As usual, the monster retains its own abilities and features unless they contradict or duplicate those provided by the template.

## Choosing Class Features and Spells

The core of applying a class template is choosing suitable features and spells for the monster. Use the following guidelines:

- **Class Features**: Choose class features up to the level equivalent to the monster's CR. For example, a monster with CR 5 would gain class features up to 5th level.

- **Spellcasting**: If the class grants spellcasting, use the monster's CR to determine its spellcasting level. Choose an appropriate number of cantrips and spells known or prepared based on that level.

- **Spell Slots**: Use the class's spell slot progression up to the level equivalent to the monster's CR.

## How to Read a Class Template

Class templates follow the same general format as functional templates. Categories of information that appear only in class templates are explained below:

- **Ability Score Increase**: This indicates which ability scores should be increased when applying the template.

- **Skills**: If the monster already has proficiency in a skill granted by the template, it can choose another skill from the class's skill list.

- **Class Features**: Refer to the relevant entries in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of class features.

- **Spellcasting**: If the class grants spellcasting, this section describes how to implement it for the monster.

- **Proficiencies**: This lists additional weapon, armor, or tool proficiencies granted by the class. If the monster already has proficiency with an item type granted by the template, it doesn't gain any additional benefit.

## Adjusting Challenge Rating

After applying a class template, reassess the monster's Challenge Rating. The additional features and abilities may increase its CR, particularly if they grant significant offensive or defensive capabilities.

Remember that the goal is to create interesting and challenging monsters, not to strictly adhere to player character creation rules. Feel free to adjust the template as needed to fit your game and maintain balance.
