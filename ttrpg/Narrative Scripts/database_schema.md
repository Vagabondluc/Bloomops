# Database Schema: Google Cloud Firestore

This document outlines the database schema for the Element Manager application, utilizing Google Cloud Firestore as its NoSQL document database. The primary data entity is the "Card," which represents a filled form or an adventure node.

## 1. Collections Overview

The main collection will be `cards`, storing all individual card documents. Other collections might be introduced for user management, templates, or prompt definitions, but the core content resides in `cards`.

*   **`cards` Collection:**
    *   Stores individual `Card` documents.
    *   Each document's ID will be its `uuid`.

## 2. Card Document Structure

Each document within the `cards` collection will represent a single card and adhere to the following structure:

*   **Document ID:** `string` (UUID of the card) - This will be the `uuid` field itself, ensuring unique and easily retrievable documents.

*   **Fields:**

    *   **`uuid`**: `string`
        *   **Description:** A universally unique identifier for the card. This also serves as the document ID in Firestore.
        *   **Example:** `"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef"`

    *   **`title`**: `string`
        *   **Description:** A concise, human-readable title for the card (e.g., "Sir Reginald the Brave," "The Whispering Woods," "The Goblin Ambush"). This is often derived from a specific field within the `formData` (e.g., `NPC Name`, `Location Name`).
        *   **Example:** `"The Sunken Temple"`

    *   **`type`**: `string`
        *   **Description:** Defines the category or type of the card (e.g., "NPC," "Location," "Adventure Hook," "Adventure Node"). This helps in rendering the correct form and UI.
        *   **Example:** `"Adventure Node"`

    *   **`description`**: `string`
        *   **Description:** A general overview or summary of the card's content. This can be a longer text field used for quick previews or search results.
        *   **Example:** `"A crumbling temple submerged in a swamp, rumored to hold ancient treasures and a lurking horror."`

    *   **`categories`**: `array<string>`
        *   **Description:** An array of strings used for flexible tagging and organization. Allows for multiple categorizations.
        *   **Example:** `["Dungeon", "Swamp", "Exploration", "Horror"]`

    *   **`formData`**: `map` (object)
        *   **Description:** A flexible map (object) containing key-value pairs representing the specific fields and their values from the form that created or edited this card. The structure of this map depends on the `type` of the card and its associated `formSchema`.
        *   **Example (for an "Adventure Node" type):**
            ```json
            {
              "nodeTitle": "The Sunken Temple",
              "nodeDescription": "A crumbling temple submerged in a swamp...",
              "challengeRating": 8,
              "encounterDetails": "Giant crocodiles and undead guardians.",
              "rewards": "A cursed amulet and 500gp."
            }
            ```

    *   **`connections`**: `array<map>`
        *   **Description:** An array of objects, defining directed connections from this card to other cards. This is particularly relevant for "Adventure Node" cards to represent branching paths.
        *   **Structure of each connection object:**
            *   **`targetUUID`**: `string` (UUID of connected card)
            *   **`connectionType`**: `string` (e.g., "linear," "choice," "branch," "prerequisite")
            *   **`label`**: `string` (optional label for the connection, e.g., "Path A," "Requires Key")
        *   **Example:**
            ```json
            [
              {
                "targetUUID": "b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-2345-67890abcdef0",
                "connectionType": "choice",
                "label": "Take the left path"
              },
              {
                "targetUUID": "c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-3456-7890abcdef01",
                "connectionType": "choice",
                "label": "Take the right path"
              }
            ]
            ```

    *   **`createdAt`**: `timestamp`
        *   **Description:** The server timestamp when the card document was first created.
        *   **Example:** `Timestamp(seconds=1678886400, nanoseconds=0)`

    *   **`updatedAt`**: `timestamp`
        *   **Description:** The server timestamp when the card document was last updated.
        *   **Example:** `Timestamp(seconds=1678887000, nanoseconds=0)`

    *   **`createdBy`**: `string`
        *   **Description:** The user ID of the user who created the card.
        *   **Example:** `"user123abc"`

## 3. Indexing Considerations

For efficient querying, especially for filtering and sorting cards, the following Firestore indexes should be considered:

*   **Single-field indexes:** Automatically created by Firestore for most fields.
*   **Composite indexes:** May be required for queries involving multiple `where` clauses or `orderBy` clauses on different fields (e.g., querying `cards` by `type` and `categories`).
    *   Example: An index on `type` ASC, `createdAt` DESC for displaying recent cards of a specific type.
    *   Example: An index on `categories` array-contains for efficient searching by category.

## 4. Security Rules (High-Level)

Firestore security rules will be crucial to control access to data.

*   **Authentication:** Only authenticated users can read/write.
*   **Authorization:** Users can only read/write their own cards, or cards shared with them (if sharing is implemented).
*   **Data Validation:** Rules can enforce data types and required fields before writes are committed.
