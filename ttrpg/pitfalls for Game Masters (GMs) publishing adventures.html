                    Seth Skorkowsky, an experienced RPG adventure module reviewer and author, provides practical advice and highlights common pitfalls for Game Masters (GMs) publishing adventures. He emphasizes that an adventure module should function as a clear, concise "recipe" for a GM to run a game, rather than a descriptive novel. Its primary purpose is to be easily usable by an unknown GM, demanding clarity and straightforwardness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key advice includes:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Wording:</strong> Utilize game-specific terminology (e.g., Dungeon Master, Keeper, Referee) and clearly distinguish between "players" (the people) and "characters" (their in-game avatars). Employ direct, active prose by avoiding unnecessary words like "will" and "that."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Ease of Reference:</strong> Structure the module for quick gameplay reference using bullet points, side boxes, and bolded mechanics. The design should prioritize a novice GM's needs, as experienced GMs can adapt to most formats.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Supplemental Material:</strong> Question the necessity of referencing rules or items from supplemental books not included in the core rulebook. If essential, include their stats or page numbers from the corebook directly. Critically, disclose *all* required supplemental books on the first page or in the product description before purchase.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Opening Information:</strong> Provide a comprehensive introduction including a brief summary, required books, suitable character archetypes, and a timeline of past and potential future events. A "dramatis personae" with quick NPC descriptions, motivations, and roleplaying hooks is also highly beneficial.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Offer multiple starting hooks and explicitly remind GMs that they are free to modify the module to fit their group's playstyle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Playtesting & Editing:</strong> Rigorously playtest the adventure, ideally with other GMs, to identify unforeseen issues. Always hire a professional editor to ensure clarity and professionalism, as authors often overlook their own mistakes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Subject Material:</strong> Be cautious with intellectual property. Ensure you have the rights to use specific material or locations. For real-world private locations, consider renaming them or using them as inspiration, clearly stating they are fictionalized. Public locations are generally safer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Maps & Handouts:</strong> Keep read-aloud sections concise. For hard-to-read handouts, always provide a typed transcript. For key location maps, include room numbers in descriptions and consider offering both a GM version (with hidden information) and a player-friendly version (without spoilers). A simple, clearly drawn map is preferable to none.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, the goal is to create an adventure that is easily understood and run by any Game Master, ensuring their experience is as smooth and enjoyable as possible.
